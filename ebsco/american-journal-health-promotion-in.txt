AB- Some would argue that if taking an examination to receive an incentive is not mandatory, it's voluntary no matter the size of the monetary reward. Others have concerns with how often employers use the word "required" when communicating how employees can earn an incentive. This in spite of clear rules that indicate "health contingent" incentive designs (those based on health measures rather than on completing activities) are an either/or proposition. That is, you can either earn (this amount) by (achieving a clinical standard) or by (participating in or attaining an alternative standard). This editorial examines the merits and demerits of organizational health contingent use of incentives. It is posited that employers can best satisfy a voluntariness standard in their use of financial incentives in wellness programs when the use of incentives are well integrated into a measurably robust, organizational culture that visibly values health; and when all employees are well versed in the meaning of, and opportunities for, reasonable alternatives for earning an incentive. Concerns about the administrative burden behind this idea and other potential unintended consequences of including measures of a culture of health to meet a voluntariness standard are also presented.

AB- <bold>Purpose:: </bold>To examine sexual, mobile technology, and sexting behaviors of college students.<bold>Design:: </bold>A cross-sectional study design was employed.<bold>Setting:: </bold>Study sites were 2 universities in the southern United States.<bold>Subjects:: </bold>Data were collected from 254 participants via online survey of college students.<bold>Measures:: </bold>The survey included 268 items inclusive of measures from previously validated sources. Variables for this study included technology ownership/use, online/mobile dating site use, sexting behaviors/attitudes, and sexual behaviors. In particular, the Sexting Attitudes Scale has been previously validated with other researchers providing comparative data.<bold>Analysis:: </bold>Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used for group comparisons. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine predictors of sexting behavior.<bold>Results:: </bold>Of the 254 participants, over 80% had ever had sex, and participants were more likely to use condoms with partners who they were not in a committed relationship compared to those to whom they were committed (χ2 = 27.324, P = .0001). Seventy percent had ever sexted, and sexting attitudes ranged from approximately 80% agreeing that sexting is "risky" or can leave one "vulnerable" compared to 43% agreeing that sexting is "fun." Sexting was associated with having multiple sexual partners (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.36-4.47) and sexually transmitted infection testing history (OR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.03-4.18).<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>Study findings should be considered as interventionists plan sexual health and risk prevention programs for college students.

AB- <bold>Purpose:: </bold>The US Department of Agriculture's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) seeks to improve the health of participating women and children by providing nutrition education and a monthly package of supplemental foods including whole grain bread and cereal. While some studies confirm that participants consume more whole grains, others find no effect. In this study, we hypothesize that the positive association between WIC and whole grains is being reduced in size and consistency by several factors.<bold>Design/setting/participants:: </bold>American households were surveyed about their food purchases. Overall response rate was 45.6%. A total of 4826 households completed the survey including 471 WIC households.<bold>Measures:: </bold>The survey recorded households' purchases of refined and whole grains in bread and cereal over 1 week.<bold>Analysis:: </bold>T tests were used to compare the bread and cereal purchases of WIC and eligible, non-WIC households. Probit models were also estimated to assess a WIC household's likelihood to choose whole grain foods when using benefits versus other payment methods.<bold>Results:: </bold>On average, WIC households acquired more whole grains in bread than eligible, non-WIC households (1.33 vs 0.72 ounce equivalents per household member aged 1 year or older; P < .05). No difference is found for cereal ( P > .10). Moreover, when using payment methods other than WIC benefits, WIC participants are 19% less likely than other households to choose whole grain bread ( P < .05) and 20% less likely to choose a whole grain cold cereal ( P < .05), which suggests that WIC-provided foods may replace some whole grains participants would otherwise buy for themselves.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>WIC is positively associated with whole grains. However, the association is stronger for bread than cereal. Moreover, foods provided through the program may partially replace whole grains that WIC households would otherwise buy for themselves.

AB- <bold>Purpose:: </bold>This study addresses the dearth of population-based research on how comprehensive household smoke-free rules (ie, in the home and car) relate to tobacco use and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure among adolescents.<bold>Design:: </bold>Analysis of 2014 Minnesota Youth Tobacco Survey.<bold>Setting:: </bold>Representative sample of Minnesota youth.<bold>Participants:: </bold>A total of 1287 youth who lived with a smoker.<bold>Measures:: </bold>Measures included household smoke-free rules (no rules, partial rules-home or car, but not both-and comprehensive rules), lifetime and 30-day cigarette use, 30-day cigarette and other product use, and SHS exposure in past 7 days in home and car.<bold>Analysis:: </bold>Weighted multivariate logistic, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions were used.<bold>Results:: </bold>Compared to comprehensive rules, partial and no smoke-free rules were significantly and positively related to lifetime cigarette use (respectively, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24-2.61; AOR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.93-4.25), and a similar significant pattern was found for 30-day cigarette use (respectively, AOR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.21-4.02; AOR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.34-4.50). No smoke-free rules significantly predicted using cigarettes and other tobacco products compared to comprehensive rules. In both descriptive and regression analyses, we found SHS exposure rates in both the home and car were significantly lower among youth whose household implemented comprehensive smoke-free rules.<bold>Conclusions:: </bold>Comprehensive smoke-free rules protect youth from the harms of caregiver tobacco use. Relative to both partial and no smoke-free rules, comprehensive smoke-free rules have a marked impact on tobacco use and SHS exposure among youth who live with a smoker. Health promotion efforts should promote comprehensive smoke-free rules among all households and particularly households with children and adolescents. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Environmental enhancements were associated with an additional significant increase in stair use (OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.25-1.37) beyond prompts alone with an average absolute increase of a further 3.5% that was sustained for 1 year. The initial increases in stair use with prompts alone were not sustained.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>Implementing environmental stairwell enhancements in office buildings increased stair usage in a sustained manner beyond that achieved by prompts alone.

Challenges included relying on ambivalent maintenance staff and residents to report violations, staff serving as both enforcers and smoking cessation counsellors, and inability to enforce on nights and weekends. Erroneous knowledge of the policy, perception that SHSe is not harmful to neighbors, as well as believing that smokers were losing their autonomy and being unfairly singled out when other resident violations were being unaddressed, hindered policy acceptance among resident smokers. The greatest challenge to compliance was the lack of allowable outdoor smoking areas that may have reduced the burden of the policy on smokers.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>Smoke-free policy implementation to support compliance could be enhanced with information about SHSe for smokers and nonsmokers, cessation support from external community partners, discussion forums for maintenance staff, resident inclusion in decision-making, and framing the policy as part of a broader wellness initiative.

Child ethnicity/race, maternal education, household tobacco exposure, family composition, and family income predicted odds of both exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months and breastfeeding for a suboptimal duration or not exclusively. Normal or high child birth weight and better maternal physical health predicted greater odds of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>Rates of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months remain low in the United States. Single-parent and step-families, lower income families, non-Hispanic black children, children with exposure to tobacco, and children of mothers with lower education are at greatest risk.

Exposure variables were knowledge of 6 SSB-related health conditions (weight gain, diabetes, dental caries, high cholesterol, heart disease, and hypertension).<bold>Analysis:: </bold>Six multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios for consuming SSBs ≥3 times/day (high intake), in relation to knowledge of SSB-related health conditions.<bold>Results:: </bold>Overall, 58% of Hispanic adults consumed SSBs ≥2 times/day and 36% consumed SSBs ≥3 times/day. Although most identified that weight gain (75%) and diabetes (76%) were related to drinking SSBs, only half identified this relation with dental caries (57%) and hypertension (41%). Even fewer identified high cholesterol (32%) and heart disease (32%) as related. In crude analyses, SSB intake was significantly associated with knowledge of the associations between SSBs and weight gain, dental caries, and heart disease; however, after adjusting for sociodemographics and acculturation, associations were no longer significant.<bold>Conclusions:: </bold>Although SSB intake was very high, knowledge of SSB-related health conditions was low and was not related to high SSB intake among US Hispanic adults. Education efforts alone may not be adequate for Hispanic adults to change their behaviors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Large employers offered more supports than small (mean: 6 vs 3), but a higher proportion of employees of small-sized employers used supports when available (59% vs 47%). The differences in offered supports between industries were not due to size alone. In regard to the determinants of participation, the personal factors of gender, age, weight, and income were associated with participation in 10 of the supports. Employer size was also associated with participation in 10 supports. No associations were found between personal factors or workplace size and participation for 3 supports.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>A higher proportion of employees working for smaller businesses use available supports than employees of larger businesses. Supports offered by employers should target the needs and interests of the workforce, particularly for the higher risk low-income employees. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Background:: </bold>Understanding factors that influence physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior is crucial to develop interventions to improve adolescents' health-related behaviors.<bold>Purpose:: </bold>To compare the influence of friends and psychosocial factors on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and screen time (ST) between normal weight (NW) and overweight (OW) adolescents.<bold>Methods:: </bold>In all, 21 OW and 21 NW adolescents wore accelerometers and completed questionnaires assessing MVPA, ST, and psychosocial variables. The MVPA and ST were assessed in nominated friends. Adolescents participated in focus groups assessing influence on activity behaviors.<bold>Results:: </bold>There were no differences in MVPA; however, NW adolescents reported less ST than OW adolescents (8.9 vs 13.1 h/wk, P = .04). For OW adolescents, friends' ST ( P = .002) and psychosocial factors ( P = .05) were associated with ST, while only PA self-efficacy was associated with MVPA. For NW adolescents, only friends' MVPA ( P = .04) was associated with self-reported PA. Exploratory analyses revealed differences among weight status and gender. Focus group discussions revealed that friends influenced both OW and NW adolescents' MVPA; however, this appeared to be more apparent for NW males, while psychosocial factors played a role in both OW and NW females. The OW adolescents reported that friends were more of an influence on their ST levels, while NW adolescents indicated that their ST was not affected by their friends' behaviors.<bold>Conclusions:: </bold>Interventions to increase MVPA and/or decrease ST may need to be tailored for NW and OW adolescents.

At 9 months after the policy, employees who were older ( P = .038) and those who had seen others violate the policy ( P < .001) were less likely to report adherence to the policy. Tobacco-using employees who worked in a county with a comprehensive smoke-free ordinance ( P = .047) were more likely to adhere to the policy.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>This study indicates the need for strong policy compliance procedures, employer-based tobacco treatment programs accompanying tobacco-free policy change, and smoke-free workplace laws to promote prohealth norms.

AB- <bold>Objective:: </bold>To identify the behavioral economics (BE) conceptual underpinnings of lifestyle financial incentive (FI) interventions.<bold>Data Source:: </bold>A mapping review of peer-reviewed literature was conducted by searching electronic databases.<bold>Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:: </bold>Inclusion criteria were real-world FI interventions explicitly mentioning BE, targeting individuals, or populations with lifestyle-related behavioral outcomes. Exclusion criteria were hypothetical studies, health professional focus, clinically oriented interventions.<bold>Data Extraction:: </bold>Study characteristics were tabulated according to purpose, categorization of BE concepts and FI types, design, outcome measures, study quality, and findings.<bold>Data Synthesis and Analysis:: </bold>Financial incentives were categorized according to type and payment structure. Behavioral economics concepts explicitly used in the intervention design were grouped based on common patterns of thinking. The interplay between FI types, BE concepts, and outcome was assessed.<bold>Results:: </bold>Seventeen studies were identified from 1452 unique records. Analysis showed 76.5% (n = 13) of studies explicitly incorporated BE concepts. Six studies provided clear theoretical justification for the inclusion of BE. No pattern in the type of FI and BE concepts used was apparent.<bold>Conclusions:: </bold>Not all FI interventions claiming BE inclusion did so. For interventions that explicitly included BE, the degree to which this was portrayed and woven into the design varied. This review identified BE concepts common to FI interventions, a first step in providing emergent and pragmatic information to public health and health promotion program planners.

However, little is known about who participates or why. This study aimed to identify sociodemographic, health, behavioral, individual, social, and environmental factors associated with higher levels of participation.<bold>Design:: </bold>Cross-sectional.<bold>Setting:: </bold>Tasmania, Australia; June 2016.<bold>Participants:: </bold>Three hundred seventy two adult parkrun participants.<bold>Measures:: </bold>Online survey measuring sociodemographic, health, individual, social and environmental factors, parkrun participation, and PA.<bold>Analysis:: </bold>Descriptive statistics, zero-truncated Poisson regression models.<bold>Results:: </bold>Respondents (n = 371) were more commonly women (58%), aged 35 to 53 years (54%), and occasional or nonwalkers/runners (53%) at registration. A total of 44% had overweight/obesity. Half had non-adult children, most spoke English at home, and 7% reported PA-limiting illness/injury/disability. Average run/walk time was 30.2 ± 7.4 minutes. Compared to regular walkers/runners at registration, nonwalkers/runners were less commonly partnered, more commonly had overweight/obesity, less physically active, and had poorer self-rated health. Multivariate analyses revealed relative parkrun participation was inversely associated with education level and positively associated with interstate parkrun participation, perceived social benefits, self-efficacy for parkrun, and intentions to participate.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>parkrun attracts nonwalkers/runners and population groups hard to engage in physical activity. Individual- and social-level factors were associated with higher relative parkrun participation. parkrun's scalability, accessibility, and wide appeal confers a research imperative to investigate its potential for public health gain.

SU- CULTURAL relativism
AB- How do we judge whether our profession is meeting its potential when, according to time honored definitions of health promotion, we consider health to be a byproduct of culture and we deem some aspects of culture to be prerequisites to health? If our profession falls short, is it because we are not doing enough to change the world? This editorial previews a new model for health promotion called "collective well-being." Collective well-being is less about how I cope with society to reach my potential and more about how we cocreate a society that enables us all to thrive. Some argue that cultural relativism means that we should not stand in judgment of cultures but can we do this without diminishing the prime role of culture in the pursuit of happiness or our innate desire to achieve optimal experience? A professional challenge for the health promotion field is to forge routes to an optimal life where personal goals and societal aspirations are one and the same. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Objectives:: </bold>To propose collective well-being as a holistic measure of the overall "health" of a community. To define collective well-being as a group-level construct measured across 5 domains (vitality, opportunity, connectedness, contribution, and inspiration) and introduce an actionable model that demonstrates how community characteristics affect collective well-being. To review the literature describing each domain's association with health outcomes and community characteristics' associations with collective well-being.<bold>Methods:: </bold>We came to consensus on topics describing each component of our conceptual model. Because "well-being" is not indexed in MEDLINE, we performed topic-specific database searches and examined bibliographies of papers retrieved. We excluded articles that were limited to narrow subtopics or studies within small subpopulations. Preference was given to quasi-experimental or randomized studies, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses. Consensus was reached on inclusion or exclusion of all articles.<bold>Results:: </bold>Reviewed literature supported each of the proposed domains as important aspects of collective well-being and as determinants of individual or community health. Evidence suggests a broad range of community characteristics support collective well-being.<bold>Conclusions:: </bold>The health and quality of life of a community may be improved by focusing efforts on community characteristics that support key aspects of well-being. Future work should develop a unified measure of collective well-being to evaluate the relative impact of specific efforts on the collective well-being of communities. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose:: </bold>Substantial research has demonstrated that assets (eg, family communication, school connectedness) protect youth from participation in numerous risk behaviors. However, very few studies have explored the relationship between assets and positive health behaviors. This study investigated prospective associations among assets and physical activity (PA) and body mass index (BMI).<bold>Design:: </bold>Longitudinal design with 5 waves of data collected annually over a 4-year period.<bold>Setting:: </bold>Community-based setting with participants recruited via door-to-door canvasing of homes located in stratified (by race and income) randomly selected census tracts and blocks.<bold>Participants:: </bold>Participants were 1111 youth (baseline mean age = 14.3 years [SD = 1.6]; 53% female; 40.6% white, 28.6% Hispanic, 24.4% black, 6.4% other) and their parents.<bold>Measures:: </bold>Weekly participation in PA, BMI, and 14 youth assets representing multiple levels of influence (individual, family, and community).<bold>Analysis:: </bold>Generalized linear mixed models assessed associations among the assets and PA and BMI over the 5 waves of data.<bold>Results:: </bold>There was a significant and graded relationship between assets and weekly participation in PA. For example, at the community-asset level, PA minutes were higher among youth with 2 assets ( P = .006), 3 assets ( P = .0006), and 4 to 5 assets ( P < .0001) compared to youth with 0 to 1 assets. No effects were found for BMI.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>Asset-based health promotion programs for youth may promote positive health behaviors and prevent participation in risk behaviors.

AB- <bold>Purpose:: </bold>The "fat-but-fit" paradigm has been evaluated. However, the duration of overweight/obesity within the "fat-but-fit" paradigm (ie, assessing body mass at more than 1 time point) has not been extensively evaluated, which was this study's purpose.<bold>Design:: </bold>Cross-sectional.<bold>Setting:: </bold>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2006.<bold>Participants:: </bold>Ages 36 to 85; N = 3621.<bold>Measures:: </bold>Physical activity assessed via accelerometry. Medical multimorbidity was assessed via physician diagnosis of 13 chronic diseases. Height and body mass were directly measured for current body mass index (BMI), and 10-year prior BMI was calculated using current height and self-reported weight 10 years prior. Six mutually exclusive groups were created: (1) active, normal weight now and 10 years ago; (2) inactive, normal weight now and 10 years ago; (3) active, overweight/obese now but not 10 years ago; (4) active, overweight/obese now and 10 years ago; (5) inactive, overweight/obese now but not 10 years ago; and (6) inactive, overweight/obese now and 10 years ago.<bold>Analysis:: </bold>Logistic regression.<bold>Results:: </bold>Compared to group 1, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were as follows: group 2: OR = 2.0 ( P = .004), group 3: OR = 1.7 ( P = .004), group 4: OR = 2.5 ( P < .001), group 5: OR = 2.9 ( P < .001), and group 6: OR = 4.8 ( P < .001).<bold>Conclusions:: </bold>All patterns of weight change/duration and activity level altered the odds of medical multimorbidity, suggesting that the duration of overweight/obesity should also be taken into consideration when assessing the "fat-but-fit" paradigm.

Accelerometers assessed total moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire assessed total active transportation and active transportation to and around work.<bold>Analysis:: </bold>Mixed-effects regression tested relations of home and worksite neighborhood environments to each physical activity outcome, adjusted for demographics.<bold>Results:: </bold>Home and worksite mixed land use and street connectivity had the most consistent positive associations with physical activity outcomes. Worksite traffic and pedestrian safety were also associated with multiple physical activity outcomes. The worksite neighborhood explained additional variance in physical activity outcomes than explained by the home neighborhood. Worksite and home neighborhood environments interacted in explaining active transportation to work, with the greatest impacts occurring when both neighborhoods were activity supportive.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>Both worksite and home neighborhood environments were independently related to total MVPA and active transportation. Community design policies should target improving the physical activity supportiveness of worksite neighborhood environments and integrating commercial and residential development.

AB- <bold>Objectives:: </bold>This study investigated the resilience of single-family housing values in walkable versus unwalkable neighborhoods during the economic downturn from 2008 to 2012 in Dallas, Texas.<bold>Methods:: </bold>Using propensity score matching and difference in differences methods, this study established a natural experimental design to compare before-and-after value changes of single-family (SF) homes in walkable neighborhoods with unwalkable neighborhoods during the Great Recession. Two thousand seven hundred ninety-nine SF homes within 18 Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts were categorized into walkable (Walk Score ≥50) and unwalkable (<50) groups. Six hundred twenty-four dwellings in walkable neighborhoods were matched with the most identical ones in the unwalkable neighborhoods by controlling for the selected structural and residential location variables. Relative average treatment effects were examined for SF values in walkable and unwalkable neighborhoods.<bold>Results:: </bold>On average, the SF homes in walkable neighborhoods held $4566 (2.08%) more value than their how walkable counterparts.<bold>Conclusions:: </bold>This study aims to help planners and decision-makers by documenting the unmet demand for walkable communities and their sustained economic benefit. Increased awareness of the sustained value of walkable communities can be used by lenders who finance and by policy makers who regulate placemaking. Results from this study can be integrated with research that demonstrates health-care cost savings of walkable environments to create an even more comprehensive set of evidence-based interventions to increase their supply.

We used the Total Worker Health framework to organize our findings and conclusions.<bold>Results:: </bold>Managers support the wellness program, but they also face challenges with accommodating employees' participation due to workload, scheduling inflexibility, and self-efficacy to discuss wellness with direct reports. About half the managers receive support from the manager above them, and most have not received training on the wellness program.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>Our findings point to several strategies that can strengthen managers' role in supporting the wellness program: the provision of training, targeted messages, formal expectations, and encouragement (from the manager above) to support employees' participation.

Data for 2013 were unavailable as the survey was not fielded in that year.<bold>Setting:: </bold>New York State.<bold>Participants:: </bold>Licensed tobacco retailers, which are stores licensed to sell tobacco in the state of New York. Between 3.6% (n = 800) and 19.7% (n = 3945) of all LTRs were sampled annually.<bold>Measures:: </bold>The presence and number of cigarette advertisements and the presence of price-reducing promotions, required age-of-sale signage, and self-service tobacco displays were documented.<bold>Analysis:: </bold>We tested for significant differences between 2014 and 2015 and significant trends overall and by outlet type. We used logistic regression for binary outcomes and Poisson regression for count variables.<bold>Results:: </bold>The number of LTRs in New York State decreased 22.9% from 2004 (n = 25 740) to 2015 (n = 19 855). The prevalence and number of cigarette advertisements and the prevalence of cigarette price-reducing promotions decreased significantly over time. Compliance with posting required age-of-sale signs increased significantly from 2004 to 2015 and from 2014 to 2015. Compliance with the ban on self-service tobacco displays was consistently near 100%.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>The tobacco retail environment in New York State improved substantially from 2004 to 2015. The implications of these findings for youth and adult smoking and the associated social costs are unknown; however, decreases in pro-tobacco marketing, decreases in the number of LTRs, and improvements in compliance are likely to have positive impacts on youth and adult smoking outcomes, such as reduced initiation and increased cessation, given previous research findings.

We also searched 3 online news databases for news items about hotels in our study, and collaboratively coded retrieved items; we analyzed the content and slant of news items.<bold>Results:: </bold>Business considerations, including guest requests, competitor action, and cost savings, were the primary motivations for implementing 100% smoke-free guest-room policies. Health concerns played a minimal role. Hotels received positive feedback from customers and employees. Media coverage was favorable, emphasizing positive aspects of going smoke-free; the overall slant of news items was positive or neutral. However, few hotels marketed the change.<bold>Conclusions:: </bold>Since hotel customers and employees are likely to experience long periods of smoke exposure and smoke-free hotels appear to be so well received, it may be timely to pursue policies making all hotels smoke-free.

Hip-based devices were more accurate and consistent for measuring step count. No significant differences were found among devices or locations for the distance measured.<bold>Conclusions:: </bold>Hip-based activity tracking devices varied in accuracy but performed better than their wrist-based counterparts for step accuracy. Distance measurements for both types of devices were more consistent but lacked accuracy. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose:: </bold>Individuals with mental illnesses have higher morbidity rates and reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. Understanding how patients and providers perceive the need for prevention, as well as the barriers and beliefs that may contribute to insufficient care, are important for improving service delivery tailored to this population.<bold>Design:: </bold>Cross-sectional; mixed methods.<bold>Setting:: </bold>An integrated health system and a network of federally qualified health centers and safety net clinics.<bold>Participants:: </bold>Interviews (n = 30) and surveys (n = 249) with primary care providers. Interviews (n = 158) and surveys (n = 160) with patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar, anxiety, or major depressive disorders.<bold>Measures:: </bold>Semi-structured interviews and surveys.<bold>Analysis:: </bold>Thematic analysis for qualitative data; frequencies for quantitative data.<bold>Results:: </bold>More than half (n = 131, 53%) of clinicians believed patients with mental illnesses care less about preventive care than the general population, yet 88% (n = 139) of patients reported interest in improving health. Most providers (n = 216, 88%) lacked confidence that patients with mental illnesses would follow preventive recommendations; 82% (n = 129) of patients reported they would try to change lifestyles if their doctor recommended. Clinicians explained that their perception of patients' chaotic lives and lack of interest in preventive care contributed to their fatalistic attitudes on care delivery to this population. Clinicians and patients agreed on substantial need for additional support for behavior changes. Clinicians reported providing informational support by keeping messages simple; patients reported a desire for more detailed information on reasons to complete preventive care. Patients also detailed the need for assistive and tangible support to manage behavioral health changes.<bold>Conclusions:: </bold>Our results suggest a few clinical changes could help patients complete preventive care recommendations and improve health behaviors: improving clinician-patient collaboration on realistic goal setting, increasing visit time or utilizing behavioral health consultants that bridge primary and specialty mental health care, and increasing educational and tangible patient support services.

Adolescent and parent knowledge that SSB intake is related to health conditions ranged from 60.7% to 80.4%: weight gain (75.0% and 80.4%, respectively), diabetes (60.7% and 71.4%, respectively), and dental caries (77.5% and 72.9%, respectively). In adjusted models, adolescent SSB intake ≥1 time/day was associated with parent intake ≥2 times/day (aOR = 3.30; 95% confidence interval = 1.62-6.74) but not with parent or adolescent knowledge of health risks.<bold>Conclusion:: </bold>Parental SSB intake may be an important factor in understanding adolescent behavior; knowledge of SSB-related health conditions alone may not influence adolescent SSB behavior.

SU- WORK environment
AB- Sleep and work take up the largest proportion of an average day for US employees. Sleep and work are also intricately related to one another. Specifically, insufficient sleep negatively impacts workplace outcomes (eg, employee productivity, absenteeism). In addition, the nature of work (eg, workload, job demands) can result in insufficient sleep or sleep difficulties among employees. Shift work is one such work characteristic that is known to adversely affect employee health. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Daily lottery incentives were designed as a "higher frequency, smaller reward" (1 in 4 chance of winning $5), "jackpot" (1 in 400 chance of winning $500), or "combined lottery" (18% chance of $5 and 1% chance of $50).<bold>Measures: </bold>Mean proportion of participant days step goals were achieved.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariate regression.<bold>Results: </bold>During the intervention, the unadjusted mean proportion of participant days that goal was achieved was 0.26 in the control arm, 0.32 in the higher frequency, smaller reward lottery arm, 0.29 in the jackpot arm, and 0.38 in the combined lottery arm. In adjusted models, only the combined lottery arm was significantly greater than control ( P = .01). The jackpot arm had a significant decline of 0.13 ( P < .001) compared to control. There were no significant differences during follow-up.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Combined lottery incentives were most effective in increasing physical activity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>We investigated the impact of elements of a workplace culture of health (COH) on employees' perceptions of employer support for health and lifestyle risk.<bold>Design: </bold>We used 2013 and 2015 survey data from the National Healthy Worksite Program, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-led initiative to help workplaces implement health-promoting interventions.<bold>Setting: </bold>Forty-one employers completed the CDC Worksite Health Scorecard to document organizational changes.<bold>Participants: </bold>Eight hundred twenty-five employees provided data to evaluate changes in their health and attitudes.<bold>Measures: </bold>We defined elements of a COH as environmental, policy, and programmatic supports; leadership and coworker support; employee engagement (motivational interventions); and strategic communication. Outcomes included scores of employees' perceptions of employer support for health and lifestyle risk derived from self-reported physical activity, nutrition, and tobacco use.<bold>Analysis: </bold>We estimated effects using multilevel regression models.<bold>Results: </bold>At the employee level and across time, regression coefficients show positive associations between leadership support, coworker support, employee engagement, and perceived support for health ( P < .05). Coefficients suggest a marginally significant negative association between lifestyle risk and the presence of environmental and policy supports ( P < .10) and significant associations with leadership support in 2015 only ( P < .05).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Relational elements of COH (leadership and coworker support) tend to be associated with perceived support for health, while workplace elements (environmental and policy supports) are more associated with lifestyle risk. Employers need to confront relational and workplace elements together to build a COH. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Subsequent subgroup analyses led to no conclusive patterns, except for greater magnitude of effect size in studies with conventional (2-arm) RCT design.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The PHC appears effective in improving glycemic control. Further research is required to assess the effectiveness of specific program components, training, and supervision approaches and to determine the cost-effectiveness of PHC interventions.

Leaders received the intervention in person or online.<bold>Measures: </bold>Phase I: At baseline and postintervention, leaders completed a wellness-promoting practice implementation questionnaire assessing practices during troop meetings (max score = 11). Phase II: Leaders completed a survey about typical troop practices and interest in further training.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Phase I: Generalized linear mixed modeling.<bold>Results: </bold>Phase I: In-person training increased wellness-promoting practice implementation more than online training (in person = 2.1 ± 1.8; online = 0.2 ± 1.2; P = .022). Phase II: Fifty-six percent of leaders adopted the training. For 8 of 11 wellness categories, greater than 50% of leaders employed wellness-promoting practices.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In-person training was superior to online training for improvements in wellness-promoting practices. Wellness training was adopted by the majority of leaders across the council. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Analysis and Results: At 6 months, there were no statistically significant differences between intervention arms and the control arm in the change in systolic blood pressure, P = .531. Similarly, there were no significant differences in blood glucose control (HbA1c) between the intervention arms and control after 6 months, P = .939. The majority of participants had acceptable systolic blood pressure (<140 mm Hg) or blood glucose (<8.0%) levels at baseline and throughout the study.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Financial incentives-regardless of whether they were delivered based on disease-relevant outcomes, process activities, or a combination of the two-have a negligible impact on health outcomes for Medicaid recipients diagnosed with either hypertension or diabetes in 2 studies in which, among other design and operational limitations, the majority of recipients had relatively well-controlled diseases at the time of enrollment.

AB- <bold>Objective: </bold>University study is often accompanied by a decline in physical activity (PA) levels but can offer the opportunity to promote a lifelong active lifestyle. This review aims to summarize controlled trials of interventions promoting PA among university students, describing the quality of the evidence, effective strategies, and deficiencies in the interventions employed, to provide directions for future research and for practical implementations.<bold>Data Source: </bold>PubMed, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, Education Source, and SPORTDiscus. Study Inclusion Criteria: Randomized or nonrandomized controlled trial, describing an intervention to promote PA in university students, where PA was one of the outcomes and results were published in English.<bold>Data Extraction: </bold>Country, study design, participants' inclusion criteria, participation rate and characteristics, randomization, blinding, theoretical framework, intervention characteristics, participant retention rate and withdrawal reasons, measures employed, data analysis, PA results, and findings regarding PA correlates.<bold>Data Synthesis: </bold>Data were synthetized considering study characteristics, strategies used, and outcomes.<bold>Results: </bold>Two thousand five hundred eighty-five articles were identified. Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies reported an increase in PA levels.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Physical Activity promotion interventions should address a range of behavioral determinants. Personalized approaches and PA sessions should be considered in future studies. The high risk of bias of many studies (mainly due to attrition and poor reporting) and missing information about intervention components limit the strength of conclusions about the most effective strategies and the evidence of effectiveness, highlighting the need for further high-quality studies.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To evaluate the temporal effects of acute exercise on episodic memory.<bold>Design: </bold>A quasi-experimental study.<bold>Sample: </bold>Eighty-eight college students (N = 22 per group).<bold>Measures: </bold>Four experimental groups were evaluated, including a control group, exercising prior to memory encoding, exercising during encoding, and exercising during memory consolidation. The exercise stimulus consisted of a 15-minute moderate-intensity walk on a treadmill. Participants completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) to assess learning and memory. Prospective memory was assessed via a Red Pen Task. Long-term memory (recognition and attribution) of the RAVLT was assessed 20 minutes and 24 hours after exercise.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) assessed the performance of RAVLT scores of trials 1 to 5 across groups. One-way ANOVA assessed the performance of individual trials across groups, whereas χ2 assessed the performance of the Red Pen Task across groups.<bold>Results: </bold>Regarding learning, the interaction of groups × trial was marginally statistically significant ( F12,332 = 1.773, P = .05), indicating that the group which exercised before encoding did better than the group that exercised during encoding and consolidation. For both 24-hour recognition and attribution performance, the group that exercised before memory encoding performed significantly better than the group that exercised during consolidation ( P = .05 recognition, P = .006 attribution).<bold>Discussion: </bold>Engaging in a 15-minute bout of moderate-intensity walking before a learning task was effective in influencing long-term episodic memory.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To investigate how mode of entry into a quitline influences program utilization and quit outcomes among clients seeking cessation services.<bold>Design: </bold>This is a retrospective analysis of clients receiving quitline services from January 2011 to June 2016.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study was conducted at the Arizona Smokers' Helpline.<bold>Participants: </bold>Enrolled clients completed a 7-month follow-up (N = 18 650).<bold>Measures: </bold>The independent variable was referral mode of entry (ie, proactive, passive, and self-referral). Outcome variables included tobacco cessation medication use, number of coaching sessions completed, and 30-day tobacco abstinence at 7 months.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Logistic regression was used to analyze tobacco abstinence after controlling for potential confounders.<bold>Results: </bold>Compared to self-referred clients, proactively referred clients were least likely (odds ratio [OR]: 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-0.97), whereas passively referred clients were most likely (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.00-1.30) to report tobacco abstinence. Proactively referred (OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.70-0.88), but not passively referred, clients were 21% less likely to report tobacco cessation medication use than self-referred clients.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Proactive referrals are associated with lower utilization of tobacco cessation medication and less successful quit outcomes; however, provider referrals are critical to reaching tobacco users who may have more significant health risks and barriers to quitting. Examining potential barriers among both providers and provider-referred clients is needed to inform improvements in training providers on brief interventions for tobacco cessation.

Feasibility was also assessed through attendance logs, benchmark achievement records, and post-implementation focus groups.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Participant characteristics and feasibility measures were summarized using descriptive statistics. Pre-post changes in effectiveness outcomes were assessed using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Focus group data were thematically examined to identify barriers to and facilitators of HEART Club progress.<bold>Results: </bold>Meeting attendance and program satisfaction were high (88% and 91%). Participants reported improvements in awareness; however, no other significant changes were observed. All HEART Clubs accomplished 3 or more project benchmarks after 6 months of implementation. Despite competing priorities and limited finances, groups effectively leveraged existing resources to achieve their goals. Important facilitators of success included stakeholder support, effective leadership, and positive group dynamics.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>These findings suggest that resident-driven initiatives that build upon local resources and establish feasible goals can successfully foster environmental change in rural communities.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine whether retrospectively assessed sports participation (SP) and competitive sports (CS) at the age of 12 years is associated with mental health and health behavior in young adulthood among males.<bold>Design: </bold>A cross-sectional study using self-administered questionnaires.<bold>Setting: </bold>Conducted prior to compulsory military refresher training course in Finland allowing geographically representative sample of Finnish young men.<bold>Participants: </bold>Six hundred eighty males aged between 20 and 35 years.<bold>Measures: </bold>Mental well-being was measured with the short version of Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale and mental distress with 5 items of The Short Form Helalth Survey (SF-36) scale.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Binary logistic regression models.<bold>Results: </bold>Sports participation at the age of 12 was associated with better mental health in young adulthood, with both mental well-being (odds ratio [OR] = 1.86, 95% confidence interval 1.11-3.11) and mental distress (OR = 0.61, 0.41-0.90). Age, years of education, and current physical activity were controlled. Higher level of intensity of SP and the level of CS in childhood were associated with lower level of mental distress in adulthood. No association was found between the level of CS in childhood and mental well-being in adulthood. Further, youth SP seemed to be a risk factor for increased alcohol consumption and use of snuff in adulthood.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Despite negative outcomes related to health behavior, the findings provide support for the association between youth SP and positive mental health outcomes in adulthood among males.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>The Hawaii Patient Reward and Incentives to Support Empowerment (HI-PRAISE) project examined the impact of financial incentives on Medicaid beneficiaries with diabetes.<bold>Design: </bold>Observational pre-post study and randomized controlled trial (RCT).<bold>Setting: </bold>Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and Hawaii Kaiser Permanente.<bold>Participants: </bold>The observational study included 2003 Medicaid beneficiaries with diabetes from FQHCs. The RCT included 320 participants from Kaiser Permanente.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Participants could earn up to $320/year of financial incentives for a minimum of 1 year.<bold>Measures: </bold>(1) Clinical outcomes of change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure, and cholesterol; (2) compliance with American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of diabetes care; and (3) cost effectiveness.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Generalized estimating equation models were used to assess differences in clinical outcomes. General linear models were utilized to estimate the medical costs per patient/day.<bold>Results: </bold>Changes in clinical outcomes in the observational study were statistically significant. Mean HbA1c decreased from 8.56% to 8.24% ( P < .0001) and low-density lipoprotein decreased from 106.17 mg/dL to 98.55 mg/dL ( P < .0001). No significant differences were found between groups in the RCT. Improved ADA compliance was observed. No reduction in total health cost during the project period was demonstrated.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The HI-PRAISE found no conclusive evidence that financial incentives had beneficial effect on diabetes clinical outcomes or cost saving measures.

The exposure measures were sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Both crude and age-adjusted prevalences were calculated. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to estimate the adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) for SSB intake by participants' characteristics.<bold>Results: </bold>In 2013, 22.0% adults with diabetes and 38.2% adults with prediabetes consumed SSBs ≥1 time/day. Among adults with diabetes, adjusted PR for consuming SSBs ≥1 time/day was significantly greater for those who had shorter duration of diabetes (≤5 years: PR = 1.47; 6-10 years: PR = 1.33 vs ≥11 years), less frequently self-checking blood sugar (≥0 to <1 time/day: PR = 1.69; ≥1 to <3 times/day: PR = 1.43 vs ≥3 times/day), and no self-management of diabetes course taken (PR = 1.25 vs yes). Among adults with prediabetes, testing blood sugar ≤3 years was not associated with consuming SSBs ≥1 time/day.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Daily SSB intake was associated with various characteristics among adults with diabetes or prediabetes. The findings can inform efforts to decrease SSB intake among high-risk populations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- As much as the field of health promotion has benefited mightily in the past decades from Internet abetted access to unlimited health content, our field is also experiencing the best of times and the worst of times. When it comes to our core work of supporting healthy decision-making for individuals, organizations, and communities, the unfettered, voluminous material available has, unimaginably, made facts seem fickle. I am delighted to have Dr Marion Nestle's insights as a preamble to this special issue of the journal. Educating about nutrition and food choices, in particular, has become as much a contest between competing interests and commercial forces, as it has been a discipline guided by credible professionals. I am all in on our Constitution's First Amendment, and having live abroad, I am endlessly smitten with America's robust expression and freedom of speech. But I wonder if our forefathers had seen the Internet coming whether they might have added more stipulations about telling the truth. This special issue of the American Journal of Health Promotion is dedicated to nutrition research where new discoveries, and impassioned scientists like Dr Nestle, provide the light needed to grow fresh knowledge. Exposing both academics and the public to well-done studies about how food choices are influenced is ever more crucial in an era of alternative facts about what constitutes healthy eating.

Intake frequency based on 4 questions versus 1 was 16.0% versus 38.5% for 0 time/day, 15.6% versus 42.5% for >0 to <1 time/day, and 68.4% versus 18.9% for ≥1 time/day. There was fair agreement for the 3 SSB intake categories (κ: .27) and poor absolute agreement between the 2 continuous measures (Lin's CCC: 0.31).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Daily SSB intake was significantly lower using a 1-question screener versus a 4-question screener. Researchers should assess SSB types separately or consider that daily SSB intake is likely underestimated with 1 question. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

The reach of this program was 10%. Prediabetics were more likely to express interest in the DPP, if they were female (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.4; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.55-3.72; P < .001), black (AOR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.43-3.47; P < .001), older in age (AOR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.99-1.17; P = .05), or had a high-risk waist circumference (AOR = 1.44; 95% CI: 0.98-2.13; P = .07), lower self-efficacy to make healthy changes (AOR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.26-0.91; P = .03), and 5 or more doctor visits in the last year (AOR = 2.13; 95% CI: 0.99-4.57; P = .05), after controlling for other covariates.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Current recruitment and implementation strategies are reaching only a small group of individuals who are not representative of the larger prediabetic population. These findings inform future engagement strategies, and we recommend that public health practitioners evaluate reach to ensure that health promotion programs are of high value. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

We measured the differences in children's health knowledge on nutrition and physical fitness and behaviors on diet and physical activity as scores.<bold>Intervention: </bold>A 6-week web- and school-based intervention for a healthier lifestyle by introducing physical fitness and science activities based on actual astronaut training under a teacher's supervision.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Nonparametric analysis and logistic regression models.<bold>Results: </bold>Participants significantly improved both of their health behaviors on physical activity ( P < .001) and diet ( P = .06) and their health knowledge regarding nutrition ( P < .001) and physical fitness ( P < .001) after the intervention. The improvement in children's behaviors ( P < .001), knowledge ( P < .001), and the total score ( P < .001) after intervention did not significantly vary by sex or age, after adjusting for year of participation and state of residency.<bold>Discussion: </bold>The MX seems effective in improving health behaviors and health knowledge of participating children, which may serve as a model for sustainable global child health promotion program. Further research is needed to test its long-term effects on child health. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Objective: </bold>This study evaluates a citywide media campaign that targeted reducing sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption as a strategy for addressing obesity.<bold>Design: </bold>Rolling cross-sectional survey data, collected before and during the media campaign, with 1367 parents to assess exposure to and effect of a televised public service advertisement (TV PSA) developed using a reasoned action approach.<bold>Setting: </bold>Televised public service advertisement campaign created by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and disseminated on cable television channels within the Philadelphia market.<bold>Participants: </bold>Philadelphia parents/primary caregivers with a child between the ages of 3 and 16.<bold>Results: </bold>Linear regression analysis shows that exposure to the TV PSA was significantly associated with intention to substitute nonsugary drinks for SSBs for the parent ( P = .04) and the child ( P = .02). The effect of exposure on intention to reduce child's SSB consumption increased the longer the campaign was in the field. Exposure was also significantly associated with the belief that reducing SSB consumption decreases the risk of diabetes ( P = .04) and was significantly negatively related to the belief that reducing SSB consumption would make mealtimes less enjoyable ( P = .04).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>These findings suggest that a theory-based mass media campaign can achieve positive changes in intention related to SSB consumption by changing relevant and salient underlying beliefs.

Exposure measures were knowledge of 6 SSB-related health conditions: weight gain, diabetes, cavities, high cholesterol, heart disease, and hypertension.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Six logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for consuming SSBs ≥2 times/d according to knowledge of SSB-related health conditions.<bold>Results: </bold>Overall, 37.8% of adults reported consuming SSBs ≥2 times/d. Although most adults identified that weight gain (80.2%), diabetes (73.6%), and cavities (71.8%) are related to drinking SSBs, fewer adults identified high cholesterol (24.1%), heart disease (31.5%), and hypertension (33.0%) as being related to drinking SSBs. Crude analyses indicated that lower SSB intake was significantly associated with knowledge of the associations between SSBs and weight gain, diabetes, cavities, and heart disease. However, after adjustment for covariates, only lack of knowledge of the association between heart disease and SSBs was significantly associated with consuming SSBs ≥2 times/d (OR = 1.29) than non-SSB consumers.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The finding that knowledge of SSB-related health conditions, in general, was not associated with high SSB intake suggests that knowledge on SSB-related health conditions alone may not be sufficient for adult behavior change.

AB- The power of lifestyle as medicine was perceived thousands of years ago. There is now consistent and compelling science to support the important influence of lifestyle on health. Approximately 80% of chronic disease and premature death could be prevented by not smoking, being physically active, and adhering to a healthful dietary pattern. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, dementia, and cancer are all influenced by lifestyle choices. Despite the ample evidence about what behaviors promote health, confusion still prevails among the general population. This is particularly true with regard to diet. Confusing nutrition messages from scientists, the media, the food industry, and other sources have made it all but impossible for any single authority to convey persuasively the fundamentals of healthful eating. The case is made here that a global coalition of diverse experts has the power to do what no individual can: clarify and popularize an understanding of the fundamentals of a health-promoting, sustainable pattern of diet and lifestyle, and rally the general public to their consistent support.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Frequent sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is associated with chronic disease. Although physician counseling can positively affect patient behavior, physicians' personal characteristics may influence counseling practices. We explored SSB-related topics physicians discuss when counseling overweight/obese patients and examined associations between physicians' SSB-related counseling practices and their personal and medical practice characteristics.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional survey.<bold>Setting: </bold>DocStyles survey, 2014.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 1510 practicing US physicians.<bold>Measures: </bold>Physician's SSB counseling on calories, added sugars, obesity/weight gain, health effects, consumption frequency, water substitution, and referral.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated with multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for physician's personal and medical practice characteristics.<bold>Results: </bold>Most physicians (98.5%) reported SSB-related counseling. The most reported topic was obesity/weight gain (81.4%); the least reported were added sugars (53.1%) and referral (35.0%). Physicians in adult-focused specialties had lower odds than pediatricians of counseling on several topics (aOR range: 0.26-0.64). Outpatient physicians had higher odds than inpatient physicians of counseling on consumption frequency and water substitution (aOR range: 1.60-2.01). Physicians consuming SSBs ≥1 time/day (15.7%) had lower odds than nonconsumers of counseling on most topics (aOR range: 0.58-0.68).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Most physicians reported SSB-related counseling; obesity/weight gain was discussed most frequently. Counseling opportunities remain in other topic areas. Opportunities also exist to strengthen SSB counseling practices in adult-focused specialties, inpatient settings, and among physicians who consume SSBs daily. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

The percentage of respondents who recognized processed foods as the major source of sodium increased from 54% in 2012 to 57% in 2015 ( P = .04), as did the percentage of respondents who buy or choose low/reduced sodium foods, from 33% in 2012 to 37% in 2015 ( P = .016). In contrast, the percentage of self-reported receipt of health professional advice among persons with hypertension decreased from 59% in 2012 to 45% in 2015 ( P < .0001). Other sodium-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors did not change significantly during 2012 to 2015.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In recent years, some positive changes were observed in sodium-related knowledge and behaviors; however, the decrease in reported health professional advice to reduce sodium among respondents with hypertension is a concern.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>The pooled cohort equations were developed in 2013 by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force to predict an individual's 10-year risk of an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate how predicted 10-year ASCVD event risk varies as a function of daily dietary behavior.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional.<bold>Setting: </bold>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2006.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 2362 adults aged 40 to 79 years.<bold>Measures: </bold>The ASCVD was assessed via the pooled cohort equations, with the Healthy Eating Index calculated from self-reported dietary behavior.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable linear and logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>Adults in the United States consuming a healthy diet (vs those not consuming a healthy diet) had an 88% increased odds of being at low risk for a future ASCVD event within the next 10 years (odds ratio [OR] = 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-2.68; P < .001). Similarly, those eating a healthy diet had a 44% reduced odds of being at high risk for a future ASCVD event within the next 10 years (OR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.34-0.93; P = .02).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Among adults who were free of cardiovascular disease, those with a healthy diet had reduced odds of being at high risk for a 10-year ASCVD event.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Food service guideline (FSG) policies can impact millions of daily meals sold or provided to government employees, patrons, and institutionalized persons. This study describes a classification tool to assess FSG policy attributes and uses it to rate FSG policies.<bold>Design: </bold>Quantitative content analysis.<bold>Setting: </bold>State government facilities in the United States.<bold>Participants: </bold>Participants were from 50 states and District of Columbia in the United States.<bold>Measures: </bold>Frequency of FSG policies and percentage alignment to tool.<bold>Analysis: </bold>State-level policies were identified using legal research databases to assess bills, statutes, regulations, and executive orders proposed or adopted by December 31, 2014. Full-text reviews were conducted to determine inclusion. Included policies were analyzed to assess attributes related to nutrition, behavioral supports, and implementation guidance.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 31 policies met the inclusion criteria; 15 were adopted. Overall alignment ranged from 0% to 86%, and only 10 policies aligned with a majority of the FSG policy attributes. Western states had the most FSG policies proposed or adopted (11 policies). The greatest number of FSG policies were proposed or adopted (8 policies) in 2011, followed by the years 2013 and 2014.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The FSG policies proposed or adopted through 2014 that intended to improve the food and beverage environment on state government property vary considerably in their content. This analysis offers baseline data on the FSG landscape and information for future FSG policy assessments. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Rates of ever/current use of e-cigarettes and hookah increased from 2013 to 2015 (all Ps < .001). In 2015, participants were 4.8 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-5.2) and 4.0 times (95% CI, 3.5-4.4) more likely to report ever/current e-cigarette use and 1.61 times (95% CI, 1.5-1.7) and 1.48 times (95% CI, 1.3-1.7) more likely to report ever/current hookah use. Participants reporting TSE were 15.4 times (95% CI, 11.5-21.0) more likely to report current poly use, and those with e-cigarette exposure were 10.4 times (95% CI, 7.8-13.8) more likely to report current poly use.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>From 2013 to 2015, rates of ever and current use of e-cigarettes and hookah increased. Tobacco smoke and e-cigarette exposure were associated with higher rates of dual and poly use. Prevention efforts targeting these products are needed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To describe the impact of the National Cancer Institute's promotion of its youth smoking cessation program, Smokefree Teen (SFT).<bold>Design: </bold>We provide a description of campaign strategies and outcomes as a means to engage a teen audience in cessation resources using a cost-effective approach.<bold>Setting: </bold>The campaign occurred nationally, using traditional (TV and radio), online, and social media outreach.<bold>Participants: </bold>Ads targeted adolescent smokers (aged 14-17). The baseline population was 42 586 and increased to 464 357 during the campaign.<bold>Measures: </bold>Metrics used to assess outcomes include (1) visits to SFT website from traditional and online ads, (2) cost to get an online ad clicked (cost-per-click), and (3) SmokefreeTXT program enrollments during the 8-week campaign period.<bold>Analysis: </bold>We conducted a quantitative performance review of all tactics.<bold>Results: </bold>The SFT campaign achieved an online ad click-through rate of 0.33%, exceeding industry averages of 0.15%. Overall, web traffic to teen.smokefree.gov increased by 980%, and the online cost-per-click for ads, including social media actions, was approximately $1 as compared with $107 for traditional ads. Additionally, the campaign increased the SmokefreeTXT program teen sign-ups by 1334%.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The campaign increased engagement with evidence-informed cessation resources for teen smokers. Results show the potential of using multiple, online channels to help increase engagement with core resources. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To test whether an antismoking parenting program provided to parents who had quit smoking for ≥24 hours increased parents' likelihood of remaining abstinent 2 and 3 years postbaseline.<bold>Design: </bold>Two-group randomized controlled trial with 3-year follow-up.<bold>Setting: </bold>Eleven states (Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, and Vermont).<bold>Participants: </bold>Five hundred seventy-seven adults (286 treatment and 291 control) who had smoked ≥10 cigarettes daily at baseline, had quit smoking for ≥24 hours after calling a Quitline, and were parents of an 8- to 10-year-old child; 358 (62%) completed the 2-year follow-up interview, and 304 (53%) completed the 3-year follow-up interview.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Theory-driven, home-based, self-help parenting program.<bold>Measures: </bold>Sociodemographic, smoking history, and 30-day point prevalence.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable regression analyses tested for group differences in 30-day abstinence. Attriters were coded as having relapsed.<bold>Results: </bold>Between-group differences in abstinence rates were 5.6% and 5.9% at 2 and 3 years, respectively. Treatment group parents had greater odds of abstinence, an effect that was significant only at the latter time point (odds ratio [OR] = 1.49, P = .075 at 2 years; OR = 1.70, P = .026 at 3 years).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This study obtained preliminary evidence that engaging parents who recently quit smoking as agents of antismoking socialization of children has the potential to reduce the long-term odds of relapse.

Agreement with 30 self-reported tobacco-related beliefs was assessed in 3 categories: (1) beliefs specifically targeted by campaign messages (campaign-targeted belief), (2) beliefs not targeted by the campaign (nontargeted beliefs), and (3) beliefs corresponding to other media campaigns on air concurrent with The Real Cost (ambiguous beliefs).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive analyses of aggregate changes in beliefs and logistic regressions to examine the association between campaign exposure and beliefs.<bold>Intervention: </bold>The Real Cost.<bold>Results: </bold>Agreement with campaign-targeted beliefs increased from baseline to first and second follow-ups, with a mean relative increase of 10.4% and 11.5%, respectively. Nontargeted beliefs did not change substantially. Both measures of campaign exposure were positively associated with increased odds of agreeing with 5 of 8 campaign-targeted beliefs. Exposure was not significantly associated with 12 of 14 nontargeted tobacco-related beliefs.<bold>Discussion: </bold>A sustained national tobacco public education campaign can change population-level perceptions of tobacco-related harms among youth.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Adolescent tobacco use is higher in rural than in urban areas. While e-cigarette use is increasing rapidly among this age group, differences in prevalence between rural versus urban populations for this relatively novel product have not been explored. The purpose is to investigate whether location of school (rural-urban) is associated with e-cigarette use and dual use (defined as the use of both e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes) among high school students.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional survey obtained using a stratified, 3-stage cluster sample design.<bold>Setting: </bold>United States.<bold>Participants: </bold>A nationally representative sample of US high school students (N = 11 053) who completed the 2014 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS); slightly more than half were urban (54%).<bold>Measures: </bold>The NYTS measures tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and use behavior and demographics of students in the United States.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Weighted logistic regression assessed the relationships of urban-rural location with current e-cigarette use and dual use, adjusting for demographic factors, perceived risk, and social norms.<bold>Results: </bold>There were clear differences in patterns of adolescent e-cigarette and cigarette use in rural versus urban areas. Social norms and perceptions may play a role in understanding these differences.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Urban youth current cigarette smokers were nearly twice as likely as rural cigarette smokers to also use e-cigarettes. Reasons for urban-rural differences need to be taken into account when designing prevention programs and policy changes. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

After narrowing to peer-reviewed articles in English and eliminating reviews and adult-only studies, we reviewed 51 articles. These 51 articles identified factors from studies at each level of the social-ecological model: intrapersonal ( k = 20), interpersonal ( k = 2), organizational ( k = 7), community ( k = 11), and public policy ( k = 14).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Findings provide insight into the applicability of NRT for adolescent smoking cessation, and factors by social-ecological model level highlight areas for additional research. Future adolescent NRT studies should assess factors at the interpersonal, organizational, and community levels, as well as the interactions between levels. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Introduction: </bold>We evaluated the specific association between exercise and smoking cessation via smoking-mediated intentions to quit smoking among a national sample of young daily smokers in the United States.<bold>Design: </bold>Prospective cohort study over a 2-year period, with daily smokers assessed across all 50 states in the United States.<bold>Setting: </bold>Data from the 2003 to 2005 National Youth Smoking Cessation Survey were used.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 1175 young adult smokers aged between 18 and 24 years.<bold>Measures: </bold>Baseline exercise and intent to quit smoking were assessed via validated survey measures. Smoking status at the 2-year follow-up period was assessed via survey assessment.<bold>Results: </bold>After adjustments, meeting exercise guidelines at baseline was associated with an increased baseline intent to quit smoking among this national sample of daily smokers (OR = 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.07; P = .01). After adjustments, those with a baseline intent to quit smoking had a 71% increased odds ratio (OR) of being a nonsmoker at the 2-year follow-up (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.20-2.44; P = .003). Baseline exercise was not associated with 2-year follow-up smoking status (OR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.60-1.28; P = .50).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In this nationally representative sample of young daily smokers, there was a positive association between exercise participation and intention to quit smoking. Baseline intent to quit smoking was independently associated with nonsmoking status at a 2-year follow-up. Thus, this indirect link between exercise and smoking status may be partially explained by the influence of exercise engagement on smoking-specific intentions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To report on adults' recall of discussion by physicians and dentists about e-cigarettes.<bold>Design: </bold>A nationally representative cross-sectional survey (Internet and random digit dialing) in the United States.<bold>Participants: </bold>Adults who ever used e-cigarettes.<bold>Measures: </bold>Participant-reported discussion about the potential benefits and harms of e-cigarettes with their doctor, dentist, or child's doctor in the past 12 months.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Fisher exact test for the analysis between benefits and harms for each type of provider and for rates of advice between provider types.<bold>Results: </bold>Among the 3030 adults who completed the survey, 523 (17.2%) had ever used e-cigarettes. Of those who had seen their doctor, dentist, or child's doctor in the last year, 7.3%, 1.7%, and 10.1%, respectively, reported discussing potential harms of e-cigarettes. Conversely, 5.8%, 1.7%, and 9.3% of patients who had seen their doctor, dentist, or child's doctor in the last year reported that the clinician discussed the potential benefits of e-cigarettes. Each clinician type was as likely to discuss harms as benefits. Rates of advice were similar between doctors and child's doctors but lower for dentists. Rates were comparable when the analysis was limited to current e-cigarette users, participants with children, or those who reported using both e-cigarettes and combusted tobacco.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Few physicians and dentists discuss either the harms or benefits of e-cigarettes with their patients. These data suggest an opportunity to educate, train, and provide resources for physicians and dentists about e-cigarettes and their use. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine interest and concerns among those who fund and operate state-run smoking cessation helplines (quitlines) about the concept of creating a centralized smokers' registry that could be used to reengage smokers after they receive initial quitline support services.<bold>Design: </bold>We conducted 3, hour-long focus groups with stakeholders, covering the perceived benefits and barriers to creating a smokers' registry.<bold>Setting: </bold>The focus groups were conducted via telephone.<bold>Participants: </bold>Three groups participated: quitline service providers (n = 14), quitline funders (n = 9), and national quitline partners (n = 8).<bold>Method: </bold>Data collection: Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and coded for major relevant themes. Analysis Strategies: We used a grounded theory approach.<bold>Results: </bold>Stakeholders were generally positive about the concept of a centralized smokers' registry (ie, QuitConnect), especially with its potential to link relapsed smokers to ongoing research studies designed to help smokers achieve abstinence from tobacco. However, stakeholders expressed concern about QuitConnect duplicating services already offered by state quitlines.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Despite a common goal, many state quitline stakeholders had strong reservations about the creation of a centralized smokers' registry unless they could see clear evidence that the registry added value and was not duplicative of their existing services.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To present nationally representative data on the prevalence of "social" smoking and its relationship to cardiovascular health.<bold>Design: </bold>A population-based, cross-sectional survey on cardiovascular health and its risk factors across the United States.<bold>Setting: </bold>Million Hearts® cardiovascular screenings that took place in community settings.<bold>Participants: </bold>De-identified data were collected on a convenient sample of 39, 555 participants.<bold>Measures: </bold>Reported smoking status, blood pressure, and total cholesterol.<bold>Analysis: </bold>The prevalence of current smoking, social smoking, and non-smoking were cross-tabulated and stratified by sample characteristics. The adjusted estimates were derived from multiple logistic regression models, adjusting for demographics and other biometric measures.<bold>Results: </bold>Ten percent identified as social smokers. Social smokers were more likely to be aged between 21 and 40, male, and Hispanic. Social smokers had significantly higher risks of having hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.80-2.41) and elevated cholesterol (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.33-1.75) than non-smokers. There was no significant difference between social smokers and current smokers (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.80-1.14 for hypertension and OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.81-1.11 for elevated cholesterol).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This is the first population health study to compare the blood pressure and cholesterol levels of people who self-identify as current verses social smokers. Although previous smoking behavior was not controlled for in the analysis, this study demonstrates there is no significant difference in the prevalence of elevated blood pressure or cholesterol among the 2 smoking groups.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To identify trajectories of smoking behaviors of a cohort of youth followed through young adulthood from 2000 to 2013.<bold>Design: </bold>The Minnesota Adolescent Community Cohort study, a population-based cohort study.<bold>Setting: </bold>Nationwide, originating in the Midwestern United States.<bold>Participants: </bold>Cohort of youth surveyed for 14 years beginning at ages 12 to 16 (N = 4241 at baseline; 59% recruitment rate).<bold>Measures: </bold>Main variable of interest was the number of days smoked in the past 30 days. Also included time-varying and time-invariant covariates.<bold>Analysis: </bold>We utilized growth mixture modeling to group individuals into trajectories over time.<bold>Results: </bold>We identified 5 distinct trajectories: nonsmokers (59.5%), early-onset regular smokers (14.2%), occasional smokers (11.5%), late-onset regular smokers (9.4%), and quitters (5.3%). Adjusted models showed that early- and late-onset regular smokers (compared to nonsmokers) had lower odds of attending or graduating from a 4-year college ( P < .05). Participants in all smoking classes compared to nonsmokers had greater odds of having more close friends who smoked ( P < .05).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Our results show that individuals in their teens through young adulthood can be classified into 5 smoking trajectories. More people in this age range remained abstainers than found in most previous studies; however, a sizable group was identified as regular smokers by the time they reached young adulthood. Interventions targeted at teens, including those that address social and environmental influences, are clearly still needed to prevent escalation of smoking as they move toward young adulthood.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>This study contributes to the emerging literature on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and queer (LGBTQ) health disparities and tobacco use by examining the motivations for smoking among the New York City (NYC) LGBTQ population.<bold>Approach: </bold>We used grounded theory and blended methods from 3 grounded theorists-Strauss, Corbin, and Charmaz-for data collection, coding, and analysis.<bold>Setting: </bold>NYC has extensive legislation to prevent smoking; however, the current smoking prevalence of homosexuals is double that of heterosexuals.<bold>Participants: </bold>Study participants were leaders from 23 NYC LGBTQ organizations. Leaders were chosen to establish a relationship with community and to ensure cultural sensitivity. Eligibility criteria required holding a leadership position in an organization serving the NYC LGBTQ community.<bold>Methods: </bold>Interviews were transcribed verbatim and uploaded into Dedoose for analysis. An initial code list was developed from the interview guide. Key themes were identified as the themes with the most number of quotes.<bold>Results: </bold>Three key themes emerged from our interviews: image, socializing, and stress. Smoking was reported to be a socialization aid and a maladaptive coping technique for stress arising from interactions of conflicting identities.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Future smoking cessation interventions among the LGBTQ community should equip smokers with healthy coping mechanisms that address the stressors that arise from the intersections of smokers' many identities.

Multiple-call participants were sent NRT in a single 4-week shipment or two 4-week shipments (second shipment sent only to those completing a second coaching call).<bold>Measures: </bold>North American Quitline Consortium recommended Minimal Data Set items collected at registration and follow-up. Thirty-day point prevalence quit rates were assessed at 7-month follow-up.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of program type and amount of NRT sent to participants while controlling for demographic and tobacco use characteristics.<bold>Results: </bold>Abstinence rates were significantly higher among 8-week versus 4-week NRT recipients (42.5% vs 33.3%). The effect was only significant between multiple-call program participants who received both 4-week NRT shipments versus only the first of 2 possible 4-week shipments (51.1% vs 31.1%). Costs per quit were lowest among web-based participants who received 4 weeks of NRT (US$183 per quit) and highest among multiple-call participants who received only 1 of 2 possible NRT shipments (US$557 per quit).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>To better balance cost with clinical effectiveness, funders of state-based tobacco cessation services may want to consider (1) allowing tobacco users to choose between phone- and web-based programs while (2) limiting longer NRT benefits only to multiple-call program participants.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To describe the content of messages sent by smokers through asynchronous counseling within a Web-based smoking cessation intervention.<bold>Design: </bold>Qualitative.<bold>Setting: </bold>National community-based setting of patients who had been engaged by the medical or dental practices at which they attended or via Google advertisements.<bold>Participants: </bold>Adults older than 19 years who were current smokers and interested in quitting. Participants throughout the United States referred to a Web-based cessation intervention by their medical or dental provider or by clicking on a Google advertisement.<bold>Methods: </bold>We conducted a qualitative review of 742 asynchronous counseling messages sent by 270 Web site users. Messages were reviewed, analyzed, and organized into qualitative themes by the investigative team.<bold>Results: </bold>The asynchronous counseling feature of the intervention was used most frequently by smokers who were white (87%), female (67%), aged 45 to 54 (32%), and who had at least some college-level education (70%). Qualitative analysis yielded 7 basic themes-Talk about the Process of Quitting, Barriers to Quitting, Reasons to Quit, Quit History, Support and Strategies for Quitting, Quitting with Medication, and Quit Progress. The most common theme was Support and Strategies for Quitting with 255 references among all messages.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>We found rich communication across the spectrum of the quit process, from persons preparing to quit to those who had successfully quit. Asynchronous smoking cessation counseling provides a promising means of social support for smokers during the quit process. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Recent data on our progress in workplace-based health promotion should keep us grounded as we consider whether we are on track to planned destinations. One recent survey suggests employees view worksite wellness as a valuable employee benefit but another survey suggests employees are dissatisfied with their employers' wellness offerings. What explains these differences? Is the program driven by a plan? Is the plan relevant to the company's priorities? Was the plan developed using participatory planning principles?" A participant centered health promotion initiative means deciding a destination and planning how to get there alongside those you aspire to serve. This approach is far more likely to lead to alternative routes and, often, untested sources of data for finding the way. The urgent opportunity for workplace-based program planners is that of strategic planning that is guided by a continuous review of credible metrics such as those offered in best practices scorecards.

AB- One of the fundamental purposes of sleep is to repair or reverse the effects of wakefulness on the body and the brain. Without regular and sufficient sleep, the wear and tear on our physiology accumulates. This can result in short-term consequences as well as longer term health risks. It's a common refrain that modern day life is impinging on our ability to get adequate sleep. Indeed, with seemingly unlimited access to digital technology, the importance of sleep seems to have become further marginalized. Sleep deprivation and sleep disorders have profound health and economic costs. In 2016, CDC assert ed that sleep deprivation had become an epidemic in the United States. Sleep deprivation is also highly prevalent among the adult populations of many developed nations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Inadequate quantity or quality of sleep, over time, creates a significant economic and public health burden in the United States. The annual direct cost of insomnia is estimated to be almost $14 billion in the United States, while the annual indirect cost of sleep-related workplace costs (due to absenteeism, lost productivity [‘‘presenteeism''], workplace accidents, and injuries) has been estimated to be $92 billion. The average number of hours of sleep per day has declined from 8 hours in the 1940s to about 6.8 hours. Sleep researchers report that adults require hours of sleep per day to promote optimal health. Short sleep duration (<7 hours per day) and sleep disorders have been linked to adverse health outcomes including cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, depression, and anxiety, as well as safety issues such as motor vehicle crashes and occupational accidents. 7,8 The 2010 National Health Interview Survey reported that 30% of employed US adults reported an average of 6 hours of sleep per day. 9 In 2015, CDC 10 declared insufficient sleep as a public health problem, and Healthy People 2020 has set an objective of 7 hours of sleep for adults.

AB- The goal of this editorial is to equip readers with opioid education resources that enable you to role model what it looks like to speak out about addiction. How are we doing as a profession speaking up about addiction? Stigma is commanded by a deep irony: where peer pressure is what likely keeps us quiet, peer support is what enables us to speak up. The "#MeToo" movement is an extraordinary example of the inertia needed to break open a taboo topic. From Hollywood celebrities to US women's gymnastics stars, it was clear that as more women spoke up about sexual harassment, well, the more women spoke out. As unnatural as it felt to talk about being harassed or abused, many simply acknowledged that it was the courage of their peers that helped them find their courage. Workplace supervisors have a front row seat for watching the epidemic and our role relates to what I consider the most straightforward definition of addiction: It is when "it" (i.e., alcohol, opioids, gambling) begins to cause problems.

AB- <bold>Introduction: </bold>Single bouts of aerobic exercise and meditation have been shown to improve anxiety states. Yet to be evaluated in the literature, we sought to examine the effects of a single, short bout of aerobic exercise or meditation, as well as exercise and meditation combined on state anxiety among young adults.<bold>Design: </bold>Randomized controlled trial.<bold>Setting: </bold>University.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Participants (N = 110, mean age = 21.4 years) were randomly assigned to walk, meditate, walk then meditate, meditate then walk, or to sit (inactive control).<bold>Measures: </bold>All walking and meditation bouts were 10 minutes in duration. Participants' state anxiety was monitored before and after the intervention using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire.<bold>Results: </bold>Significant group × time interaction effects were observed ( P = .01). Post hoc paired t tests revealed that state anxiety significantly decreased from baseline to postintervention in the meditation ( P = .002), meditation then walk ( P = .002), and walk then meditation ( P = .03) groups but not the walk ( P = .75) or control ( P = .45) groups.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Meditation (vs a brisk walk) may be a preferred method of attenuating anxiety symptomology. Individuals desiring the health benefits associated with aerobic exercise may achieve additional anxiolytic benefits if they employ a brief meditation session before or after exercising.

AB- <bold>Objective: </bold>We aim to contextualize the growing body of research on the sequelae of military service in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We employ a social-ecological (SE) framework for the taxonomy of military health research and classify risk as arising from the individual, family, community, and the institutional levels. We intend for this review to inform enhanced health promotion efforts in military communities.<bold>Data Source: </bold>Articles reviewed were extracted from Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus.<bold>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: </bold>Research focused on somatic and psychological sequelae of combat deployment published from 2001-the year the war in Afghanistan began-through the end of 2014. We excluded studies of non-US military personnel, other systematic reviews, meta-analyses, book chapters, and theoretical papers.<bold>Data Extraction: </bold>We examined and summarized the aims, participants, methods, study design, SE framework tier, risk factors, and health outcomes.<bold>Data Synthesis: </bold>Studies were categorized according to SE tier, whether they focused on somatic, behavioral, or psychological outcomes, and by risk factor.<bold>Results: </bold>Of the 352 peer-reviewed papers, 84% focused on war's sequelae on the index military personnel, and 75% focused on mental or behavioral health outcomes-mostly on post-traumatic stress disorder. We find comparatively little research focusing on the family, community, or institutional tiers.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>We know relatively little about how family and community respond to the return of personnel from combat deployment; how family resources affect the health of returning military personnel; and how a war's persistence presents challenges for federal, state, and local agencies to meet military health-care needs. Such work is especially salient as US troops return home from war-particularly in communities where there are substantial military populations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Meanwhile, prescription drugs can alleviate the symptoms of or control many diet-related chronic diseases, but these drugs may also weaken the resolve to follow recommended diets (moral hazard).<bold>Design: </bold>We measure the effect of a diagnosis of chronic disease and subsequent pharmacological treatment on the dietary quality of food purchases using a large panel data set of US consumers. We estimate the effect of prescription drug utilization on food purchases for the following chronic diseases: type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, and obesity.<bold>Participants: </bold>Panelists of the Information Resources, Inc consumer panel.<bold>Measures: </bold>Dietary quality is measured as purchases of (1) food groups (ie, fruit, vegetables, and sweets) and (2) nutrients (ie, saturated fat, fiber, sodium, sugar, and total calories).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Linear regression with mixed effects on pooled panel (household random effects, city fixed effects).<bold>Results/conclusion: </bold>We do not find strong effects of either diagnosis or pharmacological treatment of diet-related disease on food purchases.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To design and test a persuasive health promotion campaign that aligns with the qualities of trying something new for the first time. Given that a majority of students have not previously sought/considered professional mental health assistance before, the hypothesis tested in this study asked whether a campaign that takes this into account is effective with this audience.<bold>Design: </bold>Participants viewed an online informational message (n = 84), information message plus first-time experience banner (n = 99), or 1 of 4 full campaigns, each depicting a student story and photo about a first-time experience (moving from home [n = 48], skydiving [n = 52], acting in a play [n = 48], and exercising with personal trainer [n = 48]).<bold>Measures: </bold>Visual poster items: appeal (visually pleasing, 7 items, α = .92), support (value of poster, 5 items, α = .86) and behavioral intention items: engagement (participant seek help/pay attention, 3 items, α = .86), relevance (content as relevant, 3 items, α = .84), and judgment (judgment of others for not seeking help, 2 items, α = .87).<bold>Participants: </bold>College students (N = 380).<bold>Results: </bold>In comparison to information-only messages, framing mental health help seeking as a first-time experience was linked with increased appeal, support, and engagement (Minformationonly = 2.79 [standard deviation, SD = 1.34], Minformationplusbanner = 3.25 [SD = 1.23], Mfullcampaign = 4.07 [SD = 1.28], P < .001, Minformationonly = 4.38 [SD = 1.47], Minformationplusbanner = 4.92 [SD = 1.21], Mfullcampaign = 4.57 [SD = 1.26], P = .014, and Minformationonly = 3.13 [SD = 1.76], Minformationplusbanner = 3.56 [SD = 1.48], Mfullcampaign = 4.02 [SD = 1.42], P < .001, respectively). As anticipated, the full campaign garnered the highest affect and engagement scores. When comparing the 4 first-time experiences, there were main effects on support and engagement (Mtrain = 5.06 [SD = 1.17], Mplane = 4.27 [SD = 1.28], Mhome = 4.59 [SD = 1.19], Mplay = 4.38 [SD = 1.29], P = .009 and Mtrain = 4.50 [SD = 1.27], Mplane = 3.75 [SD = 1.43], Mhome = 4.01 [SD = 1.49], Mplay = 3.84 [SD = 1.39], P = .042, respectively), with the novel experience of "working with a personal trainer" rated highest.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Findings from this study have implications for the design of health promotion materials on college campuses. Specifically, campaigns that frame seeking help for mental health as a new experience potentially increase student engagement in this behavior. A key finding from the present study is that a campaign in which this behavior is linked to a familiar form of interpersonal help seeking (personal training) can create receptivity to the stigmatized issue of mental health help seeking.

The present study examined how knowledge of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) relates to receipt of preventive reproductive health services among women.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional online survey.<bold>Setting: </bold>Online questionnaires were completed via Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing website where individuals complete web-based tasks for compensation.<bold>Participants: </bold>Cisgendered women aged 18 to 44 years (N = 1083) from across the United States.<bold>Measures: </bold>Participants completed online questionnaires assessing demographics, insurance status, preventive service use, and knowledge of PPACA provisions.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Chi-squares showed that receipt of well-woman, pelvic, and breast examinations, as well as pap smears, was related to insurance coverage, with those not having coverage at all during the previous year having significantly lower rates of use. Hierarchical logistic regressions determined the independent relationship between PPACA knowledge and use of health services after controlling for demographic factors and insurance status.<bold>Results: </bold>Knowledge of PPACA provisions was associated with receiving well-woman, pelvic, and breast examinations, human papillomavirus vaccination, and sexually transmitted infections testing, after controlling for these factors. Results indicate that expanding knowledge about health-care legislation may be beneficial in increasing preventive reproductive health service use among women.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Current findings provide support for increasing resources for outreach and education of the general population about the provisions and benefits of health-care legislation, as well as personal health coverage plans.

Articles linked to religious figures were equally unpopular ( P = .59). Articles that used doctors or ordinary patients as the messenger were very likely to be selected: Nearly all women (84 [96.6%] of 87) selected at least one of these. Furthermore, the odds of choosing articles linked to celebrities or religious leaders were statistically significantly lower than the odds of choosing those linked to ordinary patients or doctors ( P < .01).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Commonly used generic messengers had large effects on the dissemination of information. Health materials linked to celebrities or religious figures were consistently less likely to be selected than those linked to ordinary patients, or doctors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To test whether message framing (ie, gain vs. loss) and risk type (ie, health vs appearance risk) in skin cancer prevention messages interact with one's prior experience.<bold>Design: </bold>Two experiments with a 2 (message framing: gain vs loss) × 2 (risk type: health vs appearance risk) factorial design were conducted.<bold>Setting: </bold>The participants were given a URL to the experiment website via e-mail. On the first page of the website, the participants were told that they would be asked to evaluate a skin cancer print public service announcement (PSA): Online experiments.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 397 individuals participated (236 for experiment 1 and 161 for experiment 2). Apparatus: Four versions of the skin cancer print PSAs were developed. Four PSAs were identical except for the 2 manipulated components: message framing and risk type.<bold>Measures: </bold>Measures were adopted from Cho and Boster (message framing), Jones and Leary and Kiene et al. (risk type), De Vries, Mesters, van't Riet, Willems, and Reubsaet and Knight, Kirincich, Farmer, and Hood (prior experience), and Hammond, Fong, Zanna, Thrasher, and Borland and Hoffner and Ye (behavioral intent).<bold>Analysis: </bold>General linear models were used to test hypotheses.<bold>Results: </bold>Three-way interactions among message framing, risk type, and prior experience were found: When the intent of the message was to encourage sunscreen use, the effects of message framing and risk type were shown to be the exact opposite directions from when the intent was to discourage indoor/outdoor tanning.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>To discourage tanning among those with prior experience, messages emphasizing losses in terms of one's health will work better. For those with no prior experience, messages emphasizing potential appearance losses will work better for discouraging tanning while messages emphasizing gains like improving appearance will do a better job in encouraging sunscreen use.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To compare 2 self-report methods of measuring weekly minutes of physical activity based on the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (ACLS) questionnaire and question 6 of the Paffenbarger Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) to determine the better predictor of adult-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).<bold>Design: </bold>An observational, prospective study.<bold>Setting: </bold>Survey data from the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) collected between 2002 and 2006 (baseline) and the Psychosocial Manifestations of Religion Sub-Study (PsyMRS), an AHS-2 subset collected 1 to 4 years later.<bold>Patients: </bold>Nine thousand eight hundred seventy-three male and female participants aged 23 to 106 years (mean, 63 years). Three hundred eighty participants reported adult-onset T2DM at follow-up.<bold>Measures: </bold>Question 6 from the PPAQ and a question adopted from the ACLS were assessed at baseline. Incident diabetes was defined as participants who reported receiving treatment for adult-onset T2DM in the last 12 months in the PsyMRS and not at baseline.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariate logistic regression analyses controlled for age, gender, ethnicity, education, body mass index (BMI), diet, and sedentary activity. Each exposure variable was compared to nonexercisers.<bold>Results: </bold>The PPAQ (odds ratio [OR]: 0.998; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.997-1.000) and the ACLS (OR: 0.999; 95% CI: 0.998-1.001) exhibited similar likelihood of predicting incident adult-onset T2DM in a healthy, mixed-gender population when controlling for several confounders.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The demonstrative nomenclature of the PPAQ may be more effectual in capturing physically active individuals than the ACLS notwithstanding generalizability and response bias limitations.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine the potential impact of paraprofessional home visitors in promoting breastfeeding initiation and continuation among a high-risk population.<bold>Design: </bold>A secondary analysis of program data from a statewide home visitation program.<bold>Setting: </bold>Thirty-six Healthy Families New York sites across New York State.<bold>Subjects: </bold>A total of 3521 pregnant mothers at risk of poor child health and developmental outcomes.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Home visitors deliver a multifaceted intervention that includes educating high-risk mothers on benefits of breastfeeding, encouraging them to breastfeed and supporting their efforts during prenatal and postnatal periods.<bold>Measures: </bold>Home visitor-reported content and frequency of home visits, participant-reported breastfeeding initiation and duration, and covariates (Kempe Family Stress Index, race and ethnicity, region, nativity, marital status, age, and education).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>Breastfeeding initiation increased by 1.5% for each 1-point increase in the percentage of prenatal home visits that included breastfeeding discussions. Breastfeeding continuation during the first 6 months also increased with the percentage of earlier home visits that included breastfeeding discussions. Additionally, if a participant receives 1 more home visit during the third month, her likelihood of breastfeeding at 6 months increases by 11%. Effect sizes varied by months postpartum.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Delivering a breastfeeding message consistently during regular home visits is important for increasing breastfeeding rates. Given that home visiting programs target new mothers least likely to breastfeed, a more consistent focus on breastfeeding in this supportive context may reduce breastfeeding disparities.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiated the Work@Health Program to teach employers how to improve worker health using evidence-based strategies. Program goals included (1) determining the best way(s) to deliver employer training, (2) increasing employers' knowledge of workplace health promotion (WHP), and (3) increasing the number of evidence-based WHP interventions at employers' worksites. This study is one of the few to examine the effectiveness of a program designed to train employers how to implement WHP programs.<bold>Design: </bold>Pre- and posttest design.<bold>Setting: </bold>Training via 1 of 3 formats hands-on, online, or blended.<bold>Participants: </bold>Two hundred six individual participants from 173 employers of all sizes.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Eight-module training curriculum to guide participants through building an evidence-based WHP program, followed by 6 to 10 months of technical assistance.<bold>Measures: </bold>The CDC Worksite Health ScoreCard and knowledge, attitudes, and behavior survey.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive statistics, paired t tests, and mixed linear models.<bold>Results: </bold>Participants' posttraining mean knowledge scores were significantly greater than the pretraining scores (61.1 vs 53.2, P < .001). A year after training, employers had significantly increased the number of evidence-based interventions in place (47.7 vs 35.5, P < .001). Employers' improvements did not significantly differ among the 3 training delivery formats.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The Work@Health Program provided employers with knowledge to implement WHP interventions. The training and technical assistance provided structure, practical guidance, and tools to assess needs and select, implement, and evaluate interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To identify effective self-persuasion protocols that could easily be adapted to face-to-face clinical sessions or health-related computer applications as a first step in breaking patient resistance.<bold>Design: </bold>Two self-persuasion interventions were tested against 2 controls in a between-subject randomized control experiment.<bold>Setting: </bold>GuidedTrack-a web-based platform for social science experiments.<bold>Participants: </bold>Six hundred seventeen adult participants recruited via Mechanical Turk.<bold>Intervention: </bold>The experimental interventions prompted participants for self-referenced pro- and counterattitudinal arguments to elicit attitude-related thought (ART) and subsequent doubt about the attitude. The hypothesis was that the self-persuasion interventions would elicit larger and more frequent attitude certainty decreases than the controls. In the experimental groups, we also predicted a correlation between the amount of ART and attitude certainty decreases.<bold>Measures: </bold>Changes in attitude certainty were measured by participants' pre- and post-ratio scale ratings; ART was measured by the number of words participants used to respond to the interventions.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Analysis of variance (ANOVA), χ2, and correlation.<bold>Results: </bold>A goodness-of-fit χ2 showed that the number of participants who decreased their attitude certainty was not equally distributed between the combined experimental groups (n = 104) and the combined control groups (n = 39), χ2(1, n = 143) = 28.64, P < .001. Within each intervention, goodness-of-fit χ2 with a Bonferroni correction ( P = .01 or .05/4) indicated there were significantly more "decreasers" than "increasers" in intervention 1, χ2(1, n = 86) = 6.16, P = .01, but not intervention 2, χ2(1, n = 84) = 2.02, P = .16, the nonsense control, χ2(1, n = 42) = .22, P = .64), or the distraction control, χ2(1, n = 34) = .02, P = .89. A 1-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect for intervention on mean certainty change ( F3,613 = 4.62, P = .003). Five post hoc comparisons using Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) test indicated that the mean decrease in attitude certainty resulting from intervention 1 (M = -3.29) was significantly larger than the mean decrease in attitude certainty resulting from the nonsense control (M = -0.62, t = -2.72, P = .03), the distraction control (M = 0.11, t = 3.48, P = .003), but not intervention 2 (M = -0.87, t = -2.54, P = .06). Attitude-related thought was significantly correlated with attitude certainty change in intervention 1, r(158) = -.17, t = -4.28, P = .02, but not intervention 2, r(161) = -.002, t = -.03, P = .98.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The implication for clinical practitioners and designers of health applications is that it may be worthwhile to let patients elaborate on their personal reasons for initially forming an unhealthy attitude to increase doubt about the strongly held attitude.

AB- Objective: Recent improvements in life expectancy globally require intensified focus on noncommunicable diseases and agerelated conditions. The purpose of this article is to inform the development of age-specific prevention guidelines for adults aged 50 and above, which are currently lacking. Data Source: PubMed, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar and explicit outreach to experts in the field. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Meta-analyses, intervention-based, and prospective cohort studies that reported allcause mortality, disease-specific mortality, or morbidity in adults were included. Data Extraction: A systematic review was undertaken in 2015 using search terms of a combination of <risk factor> and "intervention," "mortality," "reduction," "improvement," "death," and "morbidity." Data Synthesis: Interventions were categorized according to the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Level of Evidence framework. Results: A summary table reports for each intervention the impact, strength of evidence, initiation, duration, and details of the intervention. Age-decade-specific preventive recommendations have been proposed relating to physical activity, diet, tobacco and alcohol use, medication adherence, screening and vaccination, and mental and cognitive health. Conclusion: Clear recommendations have been made according to the existing evidence base, but further research investment is needed to fill the many gaps. Further, personalized approaches to healthy aging complemented by population-wide approaches and broader cross-sector partnerships will help to ensure greater longevity is an opportunity, rather than a burden, for society.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>The study identifies the extent to which theoretical constructs drawn from well-established message effect communication theories are reflected in the content of alcohol-related public service announcements (PSAs) airing in the United States over a 16-year period.<bold>Design: </bold>Content analysis of 18 530 141 alcohol-abuse (AA) and drunk-driving (DD) PSAs appearing on national network and local cable television stations in the 210 largest designated marketing areas (DMAs) from January 1995 through December 2010.<bold>Measures: </bold>The authors developed a detailed content analytic codebook and trained undergraduate coders to reliably identify the extent to which theoretical constructs and other creative ad elements are reflected in the PSAs. We show these patterns using basic descriptive statistics.<bold>Results: </bold>Although both classes of alcohol-related PSAs used strategies that are consistent with major message effect theories, their specific theoretical orientations differed dramatically. The AA PSAs were generally consistent with constructs emphasized by the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), whereas DD PSAs were more likely to use normative strategies emphasized by the Focus Theory of Narrative Conduct (FTNC) or source credibility appeals central to the Elaboration Likelihood Model.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Having identified message content, future research should use deductive approaches to determine if volume and message content of alcohol-control PSAs have an impact on measures of alcohol consumption and/or measures of drunk driving, such as fatalities or driving while intoxicated/driving under the influence arrests.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To evaluate an intervention promoting adoption of occupational sun protection policies by employers in a randomized trial.<bold>Design: </bold>A randomized pretest-posttest controlled design with 2-year follow-up was conducted in 2010 to 2013.<bold>Setting: </bold>Local government organizations in Colorado who had outdoor workers in public works, public safety, and/or parks and recreation.<bold>Participants: </bold>Ninety-eight local government organizations (n = 51 municipalities, 10 counties, and 37 special districts).<bold>Intervention: </bold>Organizations were randomly assigned to receive a policy and education intervention comprised of personal contacts and theory-based training and materials or to an attention control group.<bold>Measures: </bold>Occupational policy documents were coded for sun safety content by a trained research assistant blind to condition.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Policy scores were analyzed with logistic and Poisson regression models using imputation.<bold>Results: </bold>At posttest, more organizations in the intervention group had a sun protection policy than in the control group (odds ratio [OR] = 4.91, P < .05; intent to treat: OR = 5.95, P < .05) and policies were more extensive (χ2 = 31.29, P < .01; intent to treat: χ2 =73.79, P < .01) and stronger (χ2 = 24.50, P < .01; intent to treat: χ2 = 51.95, P < .01). Policy adoption was higher when the number of contacts and trainings increased ( P < .05).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The intervention had a large effect on adoption of formal sun protection policies, perhaps because of its fit with legal requirements to maintain safe workplaces. Personal contacts with managers were influential on adoption of occupational policy even in this age of communication technology and social media. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To evaluate whether exposure to MyFamilyPlan-a web-based preconception health education module-changes the proportion of women discussing reproductive health with providers at well-woman visits.<bold>Design: </bold>Cluster randomized controlled trial. One hundred thirty participants per arm distributed among 34 clusters (physicians) required to detect a 20% change in the primary outcome.<bold>Setting: </bold>Urban academic medical center (California).<bold>Participants: </bold>Eligible women were 18 to 45 years old, were English speaking, were nonpregnant, were able to access the Internet, and had an upcoming well-woman visit. E-mail and phone recruitment between September 2015 and May 2016; 292 enrollees randomized.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Intervention participants completed the MyFamilyPlan module online 7 to 10 days before a scheduled well-woman visit; control participants reviewed standard online preconception health education materials.<bold>Measures: </bold>The primary outcome was self-reported discussion of reproductive health with the physician at the well-woman visit. Self-reported secondary outcomes were folic acid use, contraceptive method initiation/change, and self-efficacy score.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multilevel multivariate logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>After adjusting for covariates and cluster, exposure to MyFamilyPlan was the only variable significantly associated with an increase in the proportion of women discussing reproductive health with providers (odds ratio: 1.97, 95% confidence interval: 1.22-3.19). Prespecified secondary outcomes were unaffected.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>MyFamilyPlan exposure was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of women who reported discussing reproductive health with providers and may promote preconception health awareness; more work is needed to affect associated behaviors.

Transform. Achieve. Results." to enhance employees' control over their work time, to increase supervisors' support for this change, and to increase employees' and supervisors' focus on results.<bold>Methods: </bold>We estimated the effect of the intervention on 9 self-reported employee performance measures using a difference-in-differences approach with generalized linear mixed models. Performance measures included actual and expected hours worked, absenteeism, and presenteeism.<bold>Results: </bold>This study found little evidence that an intervention targeting work-family conflict affected employee performance. The only significant effect of the intervention was an approximately 1-hour reduction in expected work hours. After Bonferroni correction, the intervention effect is marginally insignificant at 6 months and marginally significant at 12 and 18 months.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The intervention reduced expected working time by 1 hour per week; effects on most other employee self-reported performance measures were statistically insignificant. When coupled with the other positive wellness and firm outcomes, this intervention may be useful for improving employee perceptions of increased access to personal time or personal wellness without sacrificing performance. The null effects on performance provide countervailing evidence to recent negative press on work-family and flex work initiatives. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>An empirical examination of the long-term association, disaggregated by gender, between religiosity and self-rated health with reference to demographic shifts in labor force participation, education, and income.<bold>Design: </bold>General Social Survey data.<bold>Setting: </bold>United States, 1974 to 2012.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 23 353 respondents.<bold>Measures: </bold>Self-assessed health; 2 key religiosity variables: attendance and intensity of belief; income, labor market variables, education, standard demographic variables, household size, region, and time dummies.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Probit estimation conducted for the aggregate sample by gender as well as by decades to examine possible gender differential changes over time.<bold>Results: </bold>Attendance has declined overall with a much greater decline for women. The overall positive association between religiosity and health masks considerable heterogeneity across gender and time; higher and stable for males, there is no longer a significant association for females. Increased education, income, and labor force participation can explain only part of this association. Education is the strongest mediator.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The way women and men benefit from religious attendance has changed, suggesting that some pathways may be working differently for women now, especially those with less education. Moving away from church networks could be due to a perceived lack of support or substitution by other social networks. Ceteris paribus, since religious participation has been shown to weaken preference for risky consumption, declining participation, especially for women, may show up as an increase in risky behavior.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To investigate tweets about marijuana edibles for surveillance into the content of edibles-related tweets among individuals socially networking about this topic on Twitter.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional analysis of tweets containing edible marijuana-related key words during 1 month.<bold>Setting: </bold>Twitter.<bold>Participants: </bold>Tweets sent during January 1 to 31, 2015.<bold>Methods: </bold>A random sample of 5000 tweets containing edibles-related key words was coded for sentiment (positive, negative, and neutral) by crowdsourced workers. Tweets normalizing or promoting edibles use were further analyzed, and demographic characteristics of the Twitter handles sending these tweets were inferred.<bold>Results: </bold>Of the 5000 tweets, 4166 (83%) were about marijuana edibles, and of those 75% (3134 of 4166) normalized or encouraged edibles use. Nearly half (48%, 1509 of 3134) of the tweets normalizing edibles mentioned wanting or planning to consume, currently consuming, or recently consuming edibles, and 12% (378 of 3134) described the intense or long-lasting effects following use. Individuals whose tweets promoted/encouraged edibles use were more likely to be young (between 17 and 24 years old) and of a racial/ethnic minority (52% black; 12% Hispanic) when compared to the Twitter average.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Tweets that normalize edibles use have the potential to increase their popularity. The prevalence of tweets about edibles' intense high could have implications for tailoring prevention messages that could be important for youth and young adult minorities who were inferred to be disproportionately socially networking about edibles on Twitter.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Cancer mortality is worse among people with psychiatric disorders. The purpose of this study was to compare facilitators and rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening between people with and without mental illnesses.<bold>Design: </bold>We conducted a secondary analysis using data from a general population cohort study (N = 92 445) that assessed effects of 2 types of CRC screening test kits-guaiac fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)-on CRC screening completion.<bold>Setting: </bold>The setting was a health system that served approximately 485 000 members in urban and suburban Oregon and Washington.<bold>Participants: </bold>Participants were health system members, categorized by mental illness diagnosis (psychotic disorders, non-psychotic unipolar depression, and no mental illness), who were age-eligible, at average risk of CRC, and were at least 366 days past their last gFOBT with no evidence of other CRC screening.<bold>Measures: </bold>The outcome was time until completion of CRC screening.<bold>Analysis: </bold>We used Cox proportional hazard models.<bold>Results: </bold>FIT reduced CRC screening barriers for all the groups. Compared to people without mental illness diagnoses, those with psychotic disorders were equally likely to screen using FIT (hazard ratio [HR] = .95, p = .679) and those with depression were more likely (HR = 1.17, p = .006).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>FIT can improve CRC screening rates among people with mental illnesses, particularly depression.

Diabetes risk was calculated using age, gender, race/ethnicity, blood pressure, physical activity, weight status, and self-reported diagnosed type 2 diabetes.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multilevel multiple regression was conducted to test the interaction effect of support on the association between job stress and diabetes risk.<bold>Results: </bold>Mean age was 37.95 years (±12.03) and body mass index was 26.72 (±4.95). Three percent of participants reported diagnosed diabetes. Organizational support was positively associated with coworker support. Both were negatively associated with job stress. Organizational support, but not coworker support, moderated the relationship of job stress with diabetes risk. Participants with greater perceived organizational support had lower diabetes risk scores compared to those with lower perceived organizational support.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Organizational support may be a key factor for workplaces to reduce stress and diabetes risk. Further testing of organizations' supportive role on employee health may be helpful in developing future workplace programs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>The purpose of this study was to quantify the performance of organizations' worksite health promotion (WHP) activities against the benchmarking criteria included in the Well Workplace Checklist (WWC).<bold>Design: </bold>The Wellness Council of America (WELCOA) developed a tool to assess WHP with its 100-item WWC, which represents WELCOA's 7 performance benchmarks.<bold>Setting: </bold>Workplaces.<bold>Participants: </bold>This study includes a convenience sample of organizations who completed the checklist from 2008 to 2015. The sample size was 4643 entries from US organizations.<bold>Measures: </bold>The WWC includes demographic questions, general questions about WHP programs, and scales to measure the performance against the WELCOA 7 benchmarks.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive analyses of WWC items were completed separately for each year of the study period.<bold>Results: </bold>The majority of the organizations represented each year were multisite, multishift, medium- to large-sized companies mostly in the services industry. Despite yearly changes in participating organizations, results across the WELCOA 7 benchmark scores were consistent year to year. Across all years, benchmarks that organizations performed the lowest were senior-level support, data collection, and programming; wellness teams and supportive environments were the highest scoring benchmarks.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In an era marked with economic swings and health-care reform, it appears that organizations are staying consistent in their performance across these benchmarks. The WWC could be useful for organizations, practitioners, and researchers in assessing the quality of WHP programs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Response rates in each organization ranged from 3% to 34%.<bold>Measures: </bold>Leadership support for health promotion was measured with the Leading by Example instrument. Employee participation in wellness activities, job stress, and health behaviors were measured with multi-item scales.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Correlation/regression analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the relationships among the scaled variables.<bold>Results: </bold>Employees reporting higher levels of leadership support for health promotion also reported higher levels of wellness activity participation, lower job stress, and greater levels of health behavior ( P = .001). To ascertain the amount of variance in health behaviors accounted for by the other variables in the study, a hierarchical regression analysis revealed a statistically significant model (model F7,523 = 27.28; P = .001), with leadership support for health promotion (β = .19, t = 4.39, P = .001), wellness activity participation (β = .28, t = 6.95, P < .001), and job stress (β = -.27, t = -6.75, P ≤ .001) found to be significant predictors of health behaviors in the model. Exploratory regression analyses by organization revealed the focal variables as significant model predictors for only the 2 larger organizations with well-established wellness programs.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Results from the study suggest that employees' perceptions of organizational leadership support for health promotion are related to their participation in wellness activities, perceived job stress levels, and health behaviors.

Study Inclusion Criteria: Research articles published during 2011 to 2014; analyses focused on intervention targeting adolescents (10-19 years), with healthy lifestyle behaviors as main variables, delivered via mobile phone-based TM.<bold>Data Extraction: </bold>The authors extracted data from 27 of 281 articles using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method.<bold>Data Synthesis: </bold>Adolescent and setting characteristics, study design and rigor, intervention effectiveness, challenges, and risk of bias.<bold>Results: </bold>Across studies, 16 (59.3%) of 27 included non-Caucasians. The gender was split for 22 (81.5%) of 27 studies. Thirteen studies were randomized controlled trials. There was heterogeneity among targeted conditions, rigor of methods, and intervention effects. Interventions for monitoring/adherence (n = 8) reported more positive results than those for health behavior change (n = 19). Studies that only included message delivered via TM (n = 14) reported more positive effects than studies integrating multiple intervention components. Interventions delivered using TM presented minimal challenges, but selection and performance bias were observed across studies.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Interventions delivered using TM have the potential, under certain conditions, to improve healthy lifestyle behaviors in adolescents. However, the rigor of studies varies, and established theory and validated measures have been inconsistently incorporated. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- As public health funding is increasingly threatened, a better understanding is needed about how periods of funding uncertainty impact program staff, activities, and outcomes. In North Carolina, 2 years of uncertainty and threats of funding cuts for a statewide youth tobacco prevention initiative contributed to reduced grantee morale and confidence about achieving program goals, displaced focus from core program activities, and caused premature loss of personnel, resulting in substantially reduced program activities and outcomes. The range of negative impacts of funding uncertainty and threats highlights the need for programs to create an infrastructure to support ongoing sustainability planning and activities.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To assess whether exposing drinkers to information about the alcohol-cancer link via multiple and diverse sources in an online simulation produces larger improvements in attitudes and intentions relative to exposure to a single source of information.<bold>Design: </bold>Experimental; unequal randomization with respondents allocated to either the single-source (20%) or multiple-source condition (80%). Alcohol-related behavioral intentions were assessed preexposure and postexposure.<bold>Setting: </bold>Australia.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 2087 drinkers consuming alcohol at least twice per month.<bold>Measures: </bold>Scales were used to assess attitudes toward the messages (believability, convincingness, and personal relevance) and behavioral intentions (extent to which participants believed that they should and would reduce their alcohol consumption and their intention to consume 5 or more drinks in a single session).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Hierarchical linear regression.<bold>Results: </bold>Source condition was significantly associated with all 3 attitudinal variables ( P < .001). Those exposed to an alcohol warning statement from multiple sources found the message more believable, convincing, and personally relevant compared to those exposed to a warning statement via a single source. They also reported significantly greater change preexposure to postexposure on the 2 behavioral beliefs that they should (Δ M = 0.25 vs Δ M = 0.09) and would (Δ M = 0.23 vs Δ M = 0.00) reduce their current alcohol consumption ( P < .001). Further, those in the multiple-source condition reported reduced intentions to consume 5 or more standard drinks in a single sitting (Δ M = 0.21 vs Δ M = 0.14; P < .001).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Findings from the online simulation provide support for the suggestion that integrated approaches involving the combination of multiple sources to deliver a message produce superior outcomes compared to relying on a single source (eg, warning labels on alcoholic beverages).

Paired t tests were used to evaluate 1-year changes in lipid profile.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 1872 (9.9%) individuals had hyperlipidemia at screening. Among all individuals, a significantly greater rate of new hyperlipidemia diagnoses was observed during the first month after screening, compared to the 3 months before screening (odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.99 [2.66-3.36]). Among the 987 individuals who were followed up 1 year later, significant improvements were observed in total cholesterol (-8.5% ± 13.6%) and LDL levels (-10.2% ± 19.3%).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Workplace health screenings in an insured population were associated with a subsequent increase in physician visits and prescriptions for hyperlipidemia. After 1 year, significant improvements in total cholesterol and LDL levels were observed among individuals who screened positive for hyperlipidemia. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Objective: </bold>Positive youth development (PYD) often aims to prevent tobacco, alcohol, and drugs use and violence. We systematically reviewed PYD interventions, synthesizing process, and outcomes evidence. Synthesis of outcomes, published elsewhere, found no overall evidence of reducing substance use or violence but notable variability of fidelity. Our synthesis of process evaluations examined how implementation varied and was influenced by context.<bold>Data Source: </bold>Process evaluations of PYD aiming to reduce substance use and violence. Study Inclusion Criteria: Overall review published since 1985; written in English; focused on youth aged 11 to 18 years; focused on interventions addressing multiple positive assets; reported on theory, process, or outcomes; and concerned with reducing substance use or violence. Synthesis of process evaluations examined how implementation varies with or is influenced by context.<bold>Data Extraction: </bold>Two reviewers in parallel.<bold>Data Synthesis: </bold>Thematic synthesis.<bold>Results: </bold>We identified 12 reports. Community engagement enhanced program appeal. Collaboration with other agencies could broaden the activities offered. Calm but authoritative staff increased acceptability. Staff continuity underpinned diverse activities and durable relationships. Empowering participants were sometimes in tension with requiring them to engage in diverse activities.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Our systematic review identified factors that might help improve the fidelity and acceptability of PYD interventions. Addressing these might enable PYD to fulfill its potential as a means of promoting health. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Perceived disapproval from others was consistently associated with both outcomes (PF: β =.11 to 23, p ≤ .05; FoS: β =.17-.21, p ≤ .001) as was parents' perception of children's competence to travel safely (PF: β = -.24 to -.11, p ≤ .05; FoS: β = -.16 to -.13, p ≤ .01). Factors associated with FoS included having a female child (β = -.21 to -.13, p ≤ .001), language other than English (β = .09 to.11, p ≤ .01), and low levels of parent education (β = -.14 to -08, p ≤ .05).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The current study suggests that social norms, child competence, and perceptions about the benefits of CIM underpin PF. This evidence informs the development of interventions to reduce PF and promote CIM and children's physical activity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

County-level estimates included household car dependence and funding for bicycle-pedestrian projects.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable generalized linear mixed models using binary distribution and logit link, accounting for clustering within county.<bold>Results: </bold>Respondents supported policies for accommodating bicyclists and pedestrians through street improvements (89%), school active transportation programs (75%), employer-funded active commuting incentives (67%), and allocation of public funding (68%) and tax support (56%) for building and maintaining public transit. Residents spending >2 h/d (vs <0.7 hours) in cars were more likely to support street (odds ratio [OR]: 1.87; confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-3.22) and public transit (OR: 1.85; CI: 1.24-2.77) improvements. Residents in counties investing >$1.6 million in bicycle and pedestrian improvements expressed greater support for funding (OR: 1.71; CI: 1.04-2.83) and tax increases (OR: 1.73; CI: 1.08-2.75) for transit improvements compared to those with lower prior investments (<$276 100).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Support for policies to enable active transportation is higher where relevant investments in active transportation infrastructure are large (>$1.6 M), public transit is nearby, and respondents drive >2 h/d.

Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated using multinomial logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>Considering the 2 forms of commuting, 66% of the participants were being considered inactive or insufficiently active. In women, being "heavier," feeling unsafe practicing physical activity, and being a former smoker were factors negatively associated with commuting by bicycling and walking. In men, active commuting was less common among those who were overweight or had abdominal obesity, those with a negative perception of safety, and those reporting that there was nowhere suitable in the neighborhood to practice physical activity.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Obesity and negative perceptions in the neighborhood are associated with inactive or insufficiently active commuting. The relevance of this finding for public health is reinforce developing policies aimed at promoting health in Brazil and in other countries with similar characteristics. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Studies were excluded if nonhumans (ie, animal models) were studied, if children/adolescents (<18 years) or older adults (>50 years) were evaluated, and if select chronic diseases (eg, diabetes and dementia) were present.<bold>Data Extraction: </bold>A systematic review approach was employed.<bold>Data Synthesis: </bold>An extraction table was created synthesizing the key results, and recommendations for future research are emphasized.<bold>Results: </bold>Among the 17 evaluated studies, 2 were published before the year 2000 (ie, 1998 and 1999), 2 were published in 2007, and the remaining 13 were published in the years 2011 and beyond. This highlights the emergence of this research topic within this age-group (young to middle-aged adults). Among the 17 evaluated studies, 14 were conducted among healthy samples, with 3 conducted among those with a diagnosis of depression. Among the 17 studies, 4 employed a chronic training protocol, with 13 utilizing an acute exercise protocol. Among the 3 experimental studies in the depressed population, all demonstrated a favorable effect of exercise on memory function. Among the 14 trials in the nondepressed population, 10 (71%) demonstrated a favorable effect of exercise on some aspect of memory function.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Acute and chronic exercise appears to play a pronounced effect on memory function among young to middle-aged adults. Implications and recommendations for future research are outlined in this systematic review. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine the effect of a prenatal exercise intervention on gestational weight gain (GWG) and to update meta-analyses.<bold>Design: </bold>Randomized controlled trial and meta-analysis.<bold>Setting: </bold>Obstetrical practices in a Western Massachusetts hospital.<bold>Patients: </bold>We analyzed 241 ethnically diverse pregnant participants at high risk for gestational diabetes in the Behaviors Affecting Baby and You (B.A.B.Y.) study. A total of 118 participants were randomized to an exercise intervention group and 123 to a comparison health and wellness intervention group.<bold>Intervention: </bold>A 12-week individually tailored, motivationally matched program designed to increase the compliance with guidelines for exercise during pregnancy (30 min/day).<bold>Measures: </bold>The GWG and compliance with 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines for GWG abstracted from medical records.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Unadjusted logistic regression, intent-to-treat. Results were added to the existing meta-analyses using a random effects model.<bold>Results: </bold>Women randomized to the exercise group had a lower mean GWG than the comparison group (-0.97 kg, P value = .39) and were less likely to exceed IOM guidelines (odds ratio = 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-1.40), but results were not statistically significant. Meta-analyses yielded a -0.63 kg (95% CI -1.17 to -0.08, P = .02) reduction in GWG and a 20% reduction in odds of exceeding IOM guidelines (95% CI 0.73 to 0.89) for the exercise intervention.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Findings from this randomized trial among ethnically diverse women contribute to the results of meta-analyses supporting exercise as a means of attenuating GWG.

AB- Although physical activity (PA) is associated with decreased risk of chronic diseases, fewer than half of American adults meet the recommendations for daily PA, in part, due to large amounts of sedentary time in the workplace.<bold>Purpose: </bold>To determine the efficacy of an incentivized workplace PA intervention.<bold>Design: </bold>Retrospective cohort design.<bold>Setting: </bold>Large southeastern university.<bold>Participants: </bold>Of the 16 588 eligible employees working ≥8 h/wk, 6246 (37.6%) participated and 2206 (13.3%) were included in data analysis.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Six-week PA intervention with tiered incentives (value: $10.50-$29.00).<bold>Measures: </bold>Steps/day measured via consumer-grade PA monitors for 1-week pre-, 6-weeks during, and 1-week postintervention.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Participants were grouped by preintervention PA into 4 groups: <6000 (I); 6000 to 7999 (II); 8000 to 9999 (III); and ≥10 000 (IV) steps/d ( n = 481, 540, 485, and 700, respectively) in accordance with the tiered incentive schedule. Statistical comparisons were made by repeated-measures analysis of variance.<bold>Results: </bold>During the intervention, participants achieving ≥10 000 steps/d increased by 60%. Groups I, II, and III significantly increased steps/day during the intervention (46%, 24%, and 11%, respectively), which was partially maintained in groups I and II 1-week postintervention. Group IV did not increase steps/day during the intervention and significantly decreased steps/day 1-week postintervention. The estimated cost per participant of this intervention increased with from group I ($55.41) to IV ($71.90).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>An incentivized, workplace PA intervention preferentially increases PA and is most cost-effective among university employees with low initial PA who may benefit substantially from increased levels of PA.

A semi-structured interview guide facilitated individual, in-depth interviews lasting 45 to 90 minutes. Narratives were analyzed using content analysis with constant comparison technique to summarize the data.<bold>Results: </bold>Eight African American and 12 white older women with a mean age of 68 from control and intervention arms participated. Five central themes described salient strategies to promote and maintain PA: sensed benefits, motivation, and self-efficacy were central to success, while a reduction in barriers was essential before maintaining PA. The last theme, a life-changing awareness indicated that PA had become a shared value. An explanatory model describing interrelationships is presented.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This study suggests key strategies to include in PA interventions with older women. An unexpected finding was that PA became a shared value, an action promoted by the Culture of Health initiative to improve population health and well-being. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

We used Poisson regression for the count of cardiometabolic risk factors. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race, smoking, alcohol consumption, and other physical activity, with random intercepts by zip code.<bold>Results: </bold>Self-reported bicycling frequency is associated with significantly lower odds of prevalent obesity, hypertension, and high triglycerides. Three bicycling trips per week is associated with 20% fewer (95% confidence interval: 12%-28%) cardiometabolic risk factors.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Bicycling frequency is inversely associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. These results provide empirical support for the promotion of active transportation as public health policy. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

A total of 45.2% of Latinos selected the Spanish-language NDPP.<bold>Intervention: </bold>The NDPP is a nationwide translation of a clinical trial and seeks to prevent diabetes through weight loss in a yearlong group program.<bold>Measures: </bold>Independent variables included ethnicity, class language, and number of sessions attended. Main outcomes were initial attendance, number of sessions attended, and weight loss.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariate logistic regression and analysis of covariance were used to determine differences in NDPP outcomes by ethnicity, language, and number of sessions attended.<bold>Results: </bold>Mean attendance was 8.60 of 22 sessions. Each session was associated with 0.30% (±0.02; P < .001) body weight loss. Latinos were half as likely to attend as NHWs, odds ratio 0.52 ( P < .001). Latino attendees came to 2.67 ± 0.63 ( P < .001) fewer sessions than NHWs. There were no weight loss differences by ethnicity after controlling for attendance. Outcomes did not differ among Latinos in the English- and Spanish-language NDPP.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Latinos appeared to benefit less from the NDPP compared to NHWs, likely due to lower attendance rates. Further efforts are needed to support their participation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Adolescents who played school sports reported that more PA was needed for good health (β = 0.23; P = .04), had a higher enjoyment of participating in PE (β = 0.31; P = .003), engaged in more days of being physically active for ≥60 min/d (β = 0.70; P = .01), performed more pull-ups (β = 2.33; P = .008), had a stronger grip strength (β = 2.5; P = .01), and performed the plank fitness test longer (β = 11.6; P = .04).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Adolescents who had PE during school, who had more frequent and long-lasting PE, and who played school sports generally had more accurate perceptions of the amount of PA needed for good health, had greater enjoyment of PE, were more physically active, and performed better on several muscular fitness-related tests. This underscores the importance of PE integration in the schools and encouragement of school sports participation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

All women had uncomplicated and singleton pregnancies; 49 were allocated to the exercise group (EG) and 62 to the control group (CG).<bold>Intervention: </bold>The intervention program consisted of 3 weekly sessions of aerobic and resistance aquatic activities from weeks 10 to 12 until weeks 38 to 39 of gestation.<bold>Measures: </bold>Maternal weight gain, birth weight, and other maternal and fetal outcomes were obtained by hospital records.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Student unpaired t test and χ2 test were used; P values ≤.05 indicated statistical significance. Cohen's d was used to determinate the effect size.<bold>Results: </bold>There was a higher percentage of women with excessive maternal weight gain in the CG (45.2%; n = 28) than in the EG (24.5%; n = 12; odds ratio = 0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.17-0.89; P = .02). Birth weight and other pregnancy outcomes showed no differences between groups.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Three weekly sessions of water activities throughout pregnancy prevents excessive maternal weight gain and preserves birth weight.<bold>Trial Registration: </bold>The clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT 02602106.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To investigate (1) why some participants in a workplace weight management program were more engaged in the program, (2) specific barriers and facilitators for engagement and weight loss, and (3) suggest how workplaces may better engage employees in these programs to improve their effectiveness.<bold>Design: </bold>Qualitative study (8 focus groups).<bold>Setting: </bold>A large academic university and medical system.<bold>Participants: </bold>Twenty-six (5%) of the 550 employees who participated in a weight management program as part of the Steps to Health study.<bold>Measures: </bold>A trained moderator guided the audio-recorded focus groups.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Transcripts were analyzed using the directed content analysis approach.<bold>Results: </bold>Participants faced numerous barriers to engagement in workplace weight management programs, both within and outside the workplace. Participants viewed the coaches positively and reported that the coaches had a strong influence on their engagement in the program. Participants suggested increased frequency and variety of contact by coaches, on-site group exercise classes, and tailored educational materials.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Workplace weight management programs may be improved by being more flexible around participants' schedules and changing needs, by increasing access to affordable, convenient exercise facilities, and by implementing institutional changes that encourage healthy eating and physical activity during the workday. Employers should measure program engagement and solicit participant feedback to ensure that the programs are appropriate and delivered in an optimal manner. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Association between schools' characteristics and policy implementation was assessed using logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>The majority (90%) of school administrators were aware of the policies. However, only 50% to 70% of schools had implemented the policies fully. Reported barriers were lack of equipment, insufficient training, and limited time to complete implementation. Facilitators of policy implementation were commitment from the schools, staff members, students, and canteen operators. Policy implementation was comparable in all school types and locality; except the policy on "Food and Drinks sold at the school canteens" was implemented by more rural schools compared to urban schools (odds ratio: 1.74, 95% confidence interval: 1.13-2.69).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Majority of the school administrators were aware of the existing policies; however, the implementation was only satisfactory. The identified barriers to policy implementation were modifiable and thus, the stakeholders should consider restrategizing plans in overcoming them. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

At 6 months, the percentage of those meeting public health guidelines for PA increased significantly in the intervention group compared to the control group ( B = 2.06, P = .032), and for sugar-sweetened beverages, an intervention effect was found at 6 months as well ( B = -2.82, P = .003). At 12 months, for weight-related outcomes, these differences were slightly smaller and no longer statistically significant. The intervention was not effective on the total amount of moderate to vigorous PA and other dietary and health outcomes.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Intervention participants showed positive changes in vigorous PA and intake of sugar-sweetened beverages compared to controls, as well as effects on weight-related outcomes at 6 months. Long-term effects were still promising but not statistically significant. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

However, they did not produce any effect in the mall. Introducing a health message yielded an additional 12.4% increase in stair climbing in the company and a significant 11.4% increase in the mall (22.3% in phase 2). Congratulating people did not further increase stair climbing. At follow-up, the proportions of stair climbers dropped but still exceeded baseline.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Footprints tend to increase stair climbing in a worksite setting with a stair/escalator choice but not in a public setting with a stair/elevator choice. Adding a meaningful message seems essential to obtain stronger and longer term effects. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Overall, education and supervised exercise session attendance were 77% and 88%, respectively. Similar weight loss for lower and moderate fat groups (6.7 kg and 5.4 kg). The EC was unchanged baseline to month 4 but increased significantly from months 4 to 12, baseline to month 12 for both groups. The EC change baseline to month 12 was inversely associated with weight change from baseline to months 4 and 12.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Weight management interventions, likely to introduce concerns with eating attitudes, behaviors, and foods, can reduce EC. Short-term measurement of EC change captures these consequent adjustments without opportunity to regain self-efficacy. Extending the measurement interval better reflects intervention impact on EC.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Previous research demonstrates a favorable effect of physical activity on cognitive function among older adults. The potential dose-response relationship between physical activity and cognitive function in this population is less understood, which was the purpose of this study.<bold>Setting: </bold>Data from the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were employed.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 2157 older adults aged 60 to 85 years.<bold>Measures: </bold>Cognitive function was assessed from the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), expressed as metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-min-month (MET-min-month = days × duration × MET level), was assessed via self-report, with 5 MVPA categories evaluated: (1) <2000 MVPA MET-min-month, (2) 2000 to 3999 MVPA MET-min-month, (3) 4000 to 5999 MVPA MET-min-month, (4) 6000 to 7999 MVPA MET-min-month, and (5) 8000+ MVPA MET-min-month.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Weighted multivariable linear regression.<bold>Results: </bold>An inverted U-shaped relationship was observed. Consistent across several adjusted models, those who engaged in 6000 to 7999 MVPA MET-min-month had the highest cognitive function score.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The results suggest an optimal amount of physical activity to prevent the cognitive decline associated with aging.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine the effects of an employer-based monetary incentive program on membership termination and usage at a fitness center.<bold>Design: </bold>Retrospective nested case-control study examining the relationship between participation in an incentive program, visits to the fitness center, and membership termination at 1 year.<bold>Setting: </bold>University-based fitness center.<bold>Participants: </bold>Members (N = 1122) of a university-based fitness center.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Members were offered either a US$25 incentive for each month they visited the fitness center at least 10 times or no incentive.<bold>Measures: </bold>Data were extracted from the membership database and included membership termination at 1 year (yes, no), length of membership (days), participation in the incentive program (yes, no), and visits to the fitness center per month.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Cox proportional hazards model.<bold>Results: </bold>Members in the incentive program visited the fitness center on average more times per month (5.3 vs 4.3; P < .0001) but were significantly more likely to terminate memberships at 1 year compared to members who did not receive the incentive (38% vs 31%; P = .013). After controlling for relevant covariates, members who received the incentive had a 24% greater hazard of terminating their memberships compared to members who did not receive the incentive (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24; P = .041). After controlling for the number of visits per month, the incentive program was no longer significantly related to membership termination (HR = 1.21; P = .07).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Being in a monetary incentive program to attend a fitness center may be initially associated with a greater fitness center utilization but may not be associated with a reduced risk of membership termination.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine the effects of a free-living, sedentary-inducing intervention on cognitive function.<bold>Design: </bold>Randomized controlled, parallel group intervention.<bold>Setting: </bold>University campus.<bold>Participants: </bold>Thirty-three young adults (n = 23 intervention; n = 10 control).<bold>Measures: </bold>The intervention group was asked to eliminate all exercise and minimize steps to ≤5000 steps/day for 1 week, whereas the control group was asked to continue normal physical activity (PA) levels for 1 week. Both groups completed a series of 8 cognitive function assessments (assessing multiple parameters of cognition) preintervention and immediately postintervention. The intervention group was asked to resume normal PA levels for 1 week postintervention and completed the cognitive assessments for a third time at 2 weeks postintervention.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Split-plot repeated-measures analysis of variance.<bold>Results: </bold>The results of our statistical analyses showed that the group × time interaction effect was not significant ( P > .05) for any of the evaluated cognitive parameters.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>These findings demonstrate the need for future experimental investigations of sedentary behavior to better understand its effects on cognitive function. However, although previous work has demonstrated favorable effects of acute and chronic PA on cognitive function, our findings suggest that a 1-week period of reduced PA does not detrimentally affect cognitive function, which may have encouraging implications for individuals going through a temporary relapse in PA.

Study participants were predominantly female, and the majority of trials were conducted in the United States. Study heterogeneity did not allow us to conduct meta-analyses. Although interventions delivered in faith-based organizations increased physical activity and positively influenced measures of health and fitness in participants, the quality of the evidence was very low.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Faith-based organizations are promising settings to promote physical activity, consequently addressing health disparities. However, high-quality randomized clinical trials are needed to adequately assess the effectiveness of interventions delivered in faith-based organizations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

We classified individuals as having an accurate/inaccurate weight perception based on present body mass index and whether they considered themselves as overweight, underweight, or about the right weight.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>Our findings suggest that participants who were overweight/obese in the past, present, or during both time periods had increased odds of possessing an inaccurate weight perception. Furthermore, being normal weight in the past but obese in the present increased the odds of having an inaccurate weight perception nearly 10-fold and almost 5-fold for those obese in both the past and present.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Studies such as this can aid clinicians in identifying individuals who may have increased odds of inaccurately identifying their weight status, thereby providing additional opportunities to facilitate weight loss.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Limited research has evaluated the independent and additive associations of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary behavior (SB), and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with metabolic syndrome, which was the purpose of this study.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional.<bold>Setting: </bold>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2004.<bold>Sample: </bold>Three hundred seven adults aged 20 to 49 years.<bold>Measures: </bold>Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and SB were assessed via accelerometer, whereas CRF was assessed via submaximal treadmill testing. Metabolic syndrome was assessed via the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>A 10 min/d increase in MVPA was associated with a 45% reduced odds of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.40-0.76, P = .001), and a 10 mL/kg/min increase in CRF was associated with a 43% reduced odds of having metabolic syndrome (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.37-0.87, P = .013). Additionally, a statistically significant combined association of MVPA, SB, and CRF with metabolic syndrome was present; individuals who had below-median SB and above-median MVPA and CRF had an 88% reduced odds of metabolic syndrome (OR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.03-0.48, P = .005) when compared to those who had below-median MVPA and CRF and above-median SB.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>When considering MVPA, SB, and CRF, MVPA and CRF were both independently associated with metabolic syndrome (SB was not) among this young adult population and there was also evidence to support a combined association of all 3 parameters on metabolic syndrome.

AB- <bold>Introduction: </bold>To examine the association between objectively measured moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and total physical activity with school absenteeism due to illness or injury among children and adolescents.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional study.<bold>Setting: </bold>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2006.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 1249 children (aged 6-11 years) and 1747 adolescents (aged 12-17 years).<bold>Measures: </bold>School absenteeism was categorized as no/minimal school absenteeism (0-8 missed school days in the past 12 months), moderate absenteeism (9-17 missed days), or severe absenteeism (18+ missed days). Physical activity was objectively measured via accelerometry.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multinomial logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>Children in the most active quartile had 89% reduced odds of severe absenteeism relative to the least active quartile (odds ratio [OR]: 0.11; 0.95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02-0.48); results were similar for MVPA. For adolescents, those in the most active quartile for MVPA had a 41% reduced odds of having moderate (vs no/minimal) absenteeism (OR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.35-0.99). For children, a multiplicative interaction effect of MVPA and poverty level on severe absenteeism was observed (OR = 0.98, P = .02).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Higher levels of physical activity were associated with lower odds of severe school absenteeism. Such an observation is important, as school absenteeism strongly contributes to academic performance. Particular attention for promoting physical activity and closely monitoring school absenteeism among youth below the poverty level may be warranted. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To investigate the relationship between immigration-related factors and body mass index (BMI) among immigrants.<bold>Design: </bold>Secondary analyses of cross-sectional survey data.<bold>Setting: </bold>The New Immigrant Survey (NIS-2003) contains data from in-person or telephone interviews between May and November 2003, with a probability sample of immigrants granted legal permanent residency in the United States.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 8573 US immigrants.<bold>Measures: </bold>The NIS-2003 provided data on sociobehavioral domains, including migration history, education, employment, marital history, language, and health-related behaviors. The visa classifications are as follows: (1) family reunification, (2) employment, (3) diversity, (4) refugee, and (5) legalization.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Nested multivariable linear regression analysis was used to estimate the independent relationships between BMI and the variables of interest.<bold>Results: </bold>Overall, 32.6% of participants were overweight and 11.3% were obese (mean BMI = 25). Participants who were admitted to the United States with employment, refugee, or legalization visas compared with those who came with family reunion visas had a significantly higher BMI ( P < .001, P < .001, P < .01, respectively). Duration in the United States predicted BMI, with those immigrants in the United States longer having a higher BMI ( P < .001).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Our findings suggest that immigrants who obtain particular visa categorizations and immigration status might have a higher risk of being overweight or obese. Immigrants need to be targeted along with the rest of the US population for weight management interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Those in the opt-out arm received a letter stating that they were enrolled into a diabetes research study with the option to opt out, and those in the opt-in arm received a standard recruitment letter.<bold>Measures: </bold>Main end points include enrollment rate, defined as the proportion of participants who attended the baseline visit, and adherence to daily glycemic monitoring.<bold>Analysis: </bold>We powered our study to detect a 20% difference in adherence to device usage between arms and account for a 10% attrition rate.<bold>Results: </bold>Of the 569 eligible participants who received a recruitment letter, 496 were randomized to the opt-in arm and 73 to the opt-out arm. Enrollment rates were 38% in the opt-out arm and 13% in the opt-in arm ( P < .001).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Opt-out defaults, where clinically appropriate, could be a useful approach for increasing the generalizability of low-risk trials testing behavioral interventions in clinical settings.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To estimate school-level obesity burden, as reflected in prevalence of obesity, based on the characteristics of students' socioeconomic and geographic environments.<bold>Design: </bold>Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data.<bold>Setting: </bold>Public schools (N = 504) from 43 of 67 counties in Pennsylvania.<bold>Participants: </bold>Kindergarten through grade 12 students (N = 255 949).<bold>Measures: </bold>School-level obesity prevalence for the year 2014 was calculated from state-mandated student body mass index (BMI) measurements. Eighteen aggregate variables, characterizing schools and counties, were retrieved from federal data sources.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Three classification variables-excess weight (BMI ≥ 85th percentile), obesity (BMI ≥ 95th percentile), and severe obesity (BMI > 35% or 120% of 95th percentile)-each with 3 groups of schools (low-, average-, and high-prevalence) were created for discriminant function analysis, based on state mean and standard deviation of school distribution. Analysis tested each classification model to reveal school- and county-level dimensions on which school groups differed from each other.<bold>Results: </bold>Discriminant functions for obesity, which contained school enrollment, percentage of students receiving free/reduced-price lunch, percentage of black/Hispanic students, school location (suburban/other), percentage of county adults with postsecondary education, and percentage of county adults with obesity, yielded 67.86% correct classification (highest accuracy), compared to 34.23% schools classified by chance alone.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In the absence of mandated student BMI screenings, the model developed in this study can be used to identify schools most likely to have high obesity burden and, thereafter, determine dissemination of enhanced resources for the implementation of proven prevention policies and programs.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>There is a growing body of evidence that the built environment influences diet and exercise and, as a consequence, community health status. Since long-haul truck drivers spend long periods of time at truck stops, it is important to know if this built environment includes resources that contribute to the emotional and physical well-being of drivers.<bold>Setting: </bold>The truck stop environment was defined as the truck stop itself, grocery stores, and medical clinics near the truck stop that could be accessed by a large truck or safely on foot.<bold>Design: </bold>Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed and utilized a checklist to record the availability of resources for personal hygiene and comfort, communication and mental stimulation, health care, safety, physical activity, and nutrition at truck stops.<bold>Subjects: </bold>The NIOSH checklist was used to collect data at a convenience sample of 16 truck stops throughout the United States along both high-flow and low-flow truck traffic routes.<bold>Measures: </bold>The checklist was completed by observation within and around the truck stops.<bold>Results: </bold>No truck stops offered exercise facilities, 94% lacked access to health care, 81% lacked a walking path, 50% lacked fresh fruit, and 37% lacked fresh vegetables in their restaurant or convenience store.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The NIOSH found that most truck stops did not provide an overall healthy living environment.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To explore combinations of worksite supports (WSS) for physical activity (PA) that may assist employees in meeting PA recommendations and to investigate how availability of WSS differs across industries and occupations.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional.<bold>Setting: </bold>Several Missouri metropolitan areas.<bold>Participants: </bold>Adults employed >20 h/wk outside the home.<bold>Measures: </bold>Survey utilized existing self-reported measures (eg, presence of WSS for PA) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Logistic regression was conducted for 2 outcome variables: leisure and transportation PA. Independent variables included 16 WSS. Of particular interest were interaction effects between WSS variables. Analyses were stratified by 5 occupation and 7 industry types.<bold>Results: </bold>Overall, 2013 people completed the survey (46% response rate). Often, availability of 1 WSS did not increase the likelihood of meeting PA recommendations, but several pairs of WSS did. For example, in business occupations, the odds of meeting PA recommendations through transportation PA increased when employees had access to showers and incentives to bike/walk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16-2.22); showers and maps (OR = 1.25; 1.02-1.55); maps and incentives to bike/walk (OR = 1.48; 1.04-2.12).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Various combinations of WSS may increase the likelihood that employees will meet PA recommendations. Many are of low or no cost, including flexible time for exercise and maps of worksite-adjacent walk/bike routes. Findings may be instructive for employers seeking to improve employee health through worksite PA. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between the walkability/bikeability of college campuses and students' body mass index (BMI) with student physical activity (PA) attitudes and behaviors as potential mediators.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional.<bold>Setting: </bold>Thirteen university campuses.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 1384 student participants.<bold>Measures: </bold>Walkability/bikeability environmental score (ES): 12-item audit assessed an average of 44 path segments per campus. Students were measured for height and weight and completed online surveys. Physical activity stage of change/behavior intentions were assessed using the transtheoretical model. The Cognitive Behavioral Physical Activity Questionnaire assessed outcome expectations, self-regulation, and personal barriers. International Physical Activity Questionnaire assessed walking-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity PA.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive statistics, zero-order correlations, and path analysis with maximum likelihood estimation.<bold>Results: </bold>The overall model fit was good with χ2 of 171.388 ( df = 18), P < .001, comparative fit index value of .95, and a root mean square of approximation of .079. After controlling for gender, there was a direct negative association between walkability/bikeability ES and BMI (β = -.085) and positive association between personal barriers and BMI (β = .134). Walkability/bikeability ES was positively associated with walking-intensity PA (β = .010). Self-regulation was positively associated with moderate-intensity PA (β = .213), which, in turn, was negatively associated with BMI (β = -.057).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The ease of walking and biking on a campus was related to college students' walking behavior and their BMI. Students' PA behavioral intentions were associated with moderate PA and lower BMI. These results provide evidence to focus on policies and structural supports for walkable/bikeable environments to supplement and enhance interventions encouraging individual behavior change for PA and weight management.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To assess the response to information about vitamin D status by participants enrolled in employer-sponsored wellness programs.<bold>Design: </bold>A self-reported health risk assessment questionnaire was used to categorize vitamin D supplementation.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 50 209 participants of 12 employer-sponsored wellness programs that included vitamin D testing and services provided by Quest Diagnostics in 2014 and 2015.<bold>Measures: </bold>Vitamin D status based on laboratory testing results and responses to vitamin D supplementation in a health risk assessment questionnaire for initial and subsequent years.<bold>Results: </bold>Among 50 209 participants, 29% had deficient and 37% had suboptimal levels of vitamin D. Many participants appeared to act counter to their informed vitamin D status by starting supplements when vitamin D level was initially optimal (20%) or discontinuing supplements when vitamin D level was initially deficient (36%). Three-quarters of participants who had deficient or suboptimal vitamin D levels and were not taking supplements in 2014 continued not taking supplements in 2015.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Deficient and suboptimal vitamin D levels remain prevalent in a working-age population. Many participants do not seem to be taking appropriate actions after receiving vitamin D testing results. Accordingly, employer-sponsored wellness programs have an opportunity to better educate participants. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To evaluate a healthy eating and physical activity intervention for immigrant families, derived through community-based participatory research.<bold>Design: </bold>The Healthy Immigrant Families study was a randomized controlled trial with delayed intervention control group, with families as the randomization unit.<bold>Setting: </bold>US Midwest city.<bold>Participants: </bold>Participants were recruited by community partners from Hispanic, Somali, and Sudanese immigrant communities.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Family health promoters from participating communities delivered 6 healthy eating modules, 4 physical activity modules, and 2 modules synthesizing information in 12 home visits (60-90 minutes) within the first 6 months. Up to 12 follow-up phone calls to each participant occurred within the second 6 months.<bold>Measures: </bold>Primary measures were dietary quality measured with weekday 24-hour recall and reported as Healthy Eating Index score (0-100) and physical activity measured with accelerometers (14 wear days) at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months.<bold>Results: </bold>In total, 151 persons (81 adolescents and 70 adults; 44 families) were randomly assigned. At 12 months, significant improvement occurred in Healthy Eating Index scores for adults in the intervention group compared with controls (change, +8.6 vs -4.4; P < .01) and persisted at 24 months (+7.4 from baseline; P < .01). No differences were observed for adolescents and no significant differences occurred between groups for physical activity.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This intervention produced sustained dietary quality improvement among adults but not among adolescents. Program outcomes are relevant to communities working to decrease cardiovascular risk among immigrant populations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Survey respondents included school administrators, physical education (PE) teachers, and grade-level chairs.<bold>Measures: </bold>Physical activity environment factors were assessed via an online questionnaire adapted from school PA surveys and articles.<bold>Analysis: </bold>The chi-square and Fisher exact analyses were conducted to examine the reporting of PA environment factors overall and by school SES, as measured by free/reduced lunch rate, and/or racial/ethnic composition.<bold>Results: </bold>Overall, many PA environment factors were widely prevalent (ie, gym [99%] or field [79%] access), although some factors such as some PA-related programs (ie, a structured walk/bike program [11%]) were less widely reported. Disparities in school PA environment factors were largely patterned by SES, though they varied for some factors by racial/ethnic composition and across SES within racial/ethnic composition categories. For example, lower SES schools were less likely to report access to blacktops and tracks ( p-value < .0001), and higher SES schools were less likely to report access to playgrounds ( p-value = .0076). Lower SES schools were also less likely to report "always/often" giving access to PE/PA equipment during recess ( p-value < .01). Lower SES and majority nonwhite schools were less likely to report having joint use agreements with community agencies ( p-value < .0001).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This study highlights SES and racial/ethnic disparities in PA environments in Georgia public elementary schools.

Logistic regression analysis incorporated other measures as covariates to adjust for differences between groups, with HRA and biometric screening participation rates determined as binary outcomes.<bold>Results: </bold>Participation rates for HRA and biometric screening were 90% and 87%, respectively, in the highest wage category, decreasing to 67% and 60%, respectively, among the lowest wage category.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Employee wage status is associated with significant differences in HRA and biometric participation rates. Generalizing the results generated by modest participation in these offerings to entire populations may risk misinterpretation of results based on variable participation rates across wage categories.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine the association between characteristics of social support for exercise and moderate-to-vigorous leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) among Latinas.<bold>Design: </bold>This cross-sectional study used baseline data from a cluster randomized controlled trial.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study was conducted in 16 churches located in San Diego County.<bold>Participants: </bold>Participants (N = 436) were Latinas between 18 and 65 years old who did not self-report >150 minutes or did not exceed 250 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA per week measured by accelerometer.<bold>Measures: </bold>Latinas listed up to 6 individuals who had provided support for exercise within the past 6 months, including their gender, relationship with the respondent, types of support provided, and respondent's satisfaction with support. Self-reported LTPA was dichotomized (none vs any).<bold>Analyses: </bold>We generated dyads between Latinas who named ≥1 supporter (n = 323) and each supporter they named (n = 569 dyads). Logistic regression analyses were conducted using generalized estimating equations to adjust for multiple observations per participant.<bold>Results: </bold>Having an exercise partner (odds ratio [OR]: 2.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-4.62), help with household duties (OR: 2.70; 95% CI: 1.35-3.38), being "very much" satisfied with support (OR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.26-4.30), and naming >2 supporters (OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.06-6.25) was positively associated with LTPA.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Findings suggest specific aspects of support for exercise that should be targeted in future interventions to promote LTPA.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine whether perceived safety modified the effectiveness of the Walk Your Heart to Health (WYHH) intervention in promoting physical activity and reducing central adiposity in predominantly non-Latino black (henceforth black) and Latino communities.<bold>Design: </bold>Generalized estimation equations were used to assess modifying effects of perceived safety on the route and perceived neighborhood safety on (1) WYHH participation at 8 weeks and 32 weeks, (2) associations between participation and physical activity, and (3) associations between physical activity and central adiposity.<bold>Setting: </bold>Community-based and faith-based organizations in black and Latino communities.<bold>Participants: </bold>There were 603 adults, aged 18 years and older, who were predominantly black, Latino, and female.<bold>Measures: </bold>Participation and physical activity (piezoelectric pedometer) were measured at each walking session. Perceived safety on the route (questionnaire), perceived neighborhood safety (questionnaire), and waist circumference were measured at baseline, 8 weeks, and 32 weeks.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Secondary analysis of repeated measures using generalized estimation equations.<bold>Results: </bold>Retention was 90% at 8 weeks and 64% at 32 weeks. Perceived safety on the route, but not perceived neighborhood safety, dampened participation at 8 weeks but not 32 weeks. Consistent participation in the intervention increased physical activity and reduced central adiposity irrespective of perceived safety on the walking route or perceived neighborhood safety.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Efforts to improve safety in conjunction with interventions focused on increasing physical activity can work toward improving physical activity for blacks and Latinos, leading to a myriad of improved health outcomes including reduced central adiposity.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Higher prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in rural America have been consistently reported, but sources of these disparities are not well known. This study presented patterns and mechanisms of these disparities among working age Americans.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional study.<bold>Setting: </bold>United States of America.<bold>Participants: </bold>The study included 10 302 participants of the 2003-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) who were 20 to 64 years old, not pregnant, and with a body mass index ranging from 18.5 to 60.<bold>Measures: </bold>Individual-level data were from NHANES including age, gender, race/ethnicity, immigrant status, education, and family income. The outcomes were prevalence of obesity and prevalence of overweight and obesity combined. Neighborhood data were constructed from the 2000 US Census providing tract-level information on family median income and built environmental features and from the 2006 ESRI ArcGIS 9.3 Data DVD providing tract-level park location information.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Geographic information system (GIS) methods were used to create a measure of spatial distance to local parks capturing park accessibility. Random intercept logistic and ordinal logit regression analyses were performed.<bold>Findings: </bold>Multivariate regression results showed that the odds of obesity was higher in rural areas compared to urban areas (odds ratio = 1.358, P < .001) net of demographic controls and that this gap was largely attributable to individual educational attainment and neighborhood median household income and neighborhood built environmental features. After controlling for these hypothesized mediators, the elevated odds associated with rural residence was reduced by nearly 94% and rendered statistically insignificant.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>In this nationally representative cross-sectional sample, rural-urban obesity disparities were large and explained by rural-urban educational differences at the individual level and economic and built environmental differences at the neighborhood level.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To assess the association between growth and maturation with weight management behaviors (WMBs) among Mexican American youth.<bold>Design: </bold>A cross-sectional design was used to measure timing of growth and maturation as well as WMBs.<bold>Sample: </bold>Students were recruited through physical education classes in south Texas schools. The sample included 623 participants (52.3% female; 49.8% with weight ≥85th percentile) in grades 4 through 12. Students in middle school were purposely oversampled to examine questions around timing of growth and maturation.<bold>Measures: </bold>Growth was measured as maturity offset, an estimate of age at peak height velocity (PHV). Maturity offset is derived from chronological age, height, and sitting height measurements. Participants were classified as pre-PHV or post-PHV. Girls also were categorized as premenarche or early, average, or late maturing based on age at menarche. Weight was measured to calculate body mass index (BMI) percentile. Weight management behavior and timing of menarche were self-reported via a survey.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive characteristics were calculated for boys and girls separately. χ2 Tests of proportion were used to test WMB by BMI percentile. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the likelihood of engaging in WMB by maturity offset and, for girls, timing of menarche.<bold>Results: </bold>Students with weight ≥85th percentile were more likely to describe themselves as overweight and report trying to lose weight through exercise or calorie restriction ( P < .0001). A 1-year increase in maturity offset was associated with youth being 31% more likely to perceive themselves as overweight but less likely to report calorie restriction (odds ratio [OR] = 0.87). Average maturing girls were more likely than premenarcheal girls to exercise, restrict calories, or fast to lose weight (OR = 3.27, 2.11, and 3.27, respectively).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Mexican American youth are engaging in WMB, even when their weight status is <85th percentile. The appropriateness of weight management counseling may need to consider a child's stage of growth. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

We used a grounded theory approach to analyze the transcripts.<bold>Results: </bold>Community social norms supportive of cigarette smoking and co-use of tobacco with other illicit substances were strong motivators of initiation and maintenance of tobacco use. Self-reported barriers to cessation included nicotine dependence, the experience of being homeless, fatalistic attitudes toward smoking cessation, substance use, and exposure to tobacco industry marketing. While participants were cognizant of current tobacco control policies and interventions for cessation, they felt that they were not specific enough for African Americans experiencing homelessness. Participants expressed strong support for strategies that de-normalized tobacco use and advertised the harmful effects of tobacco.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Older African American homeless-experienced smokers face significant barriers to smoking cessation. Interventions that advertise the harmful effects of tobacco may be effective in stimulating smoking cessation among this population. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Low-income, African American women are disproportionately impacted by obesity. Little is known about the interactions between low-income, African American women who successfully lost weight and their primary care physicians (PCPs).<bold>Design: </bold>Mixed methods, positive deviance study.<bold>Setting: </bold>Urban university-based family medicine practice.<bold>Participants: </bold>The positive deviance group comprised low-income, African American women who were obese, lost 10% body weight, and maintained this loss for 6 months.<bold>Measures: </bold>The PCP- and patient-reported weight-related variables collected through the electronic medical record (EMR), surveys, and interviews.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Logistic regression of quantitative variables. Qualitative analysis using modified grounded theory.<bold>Results: </bold>The EMR documentation by PCPs of dietary counseling and a weight-related medical problem were significant predictors of positive deviant group membership. Qualitative analyses of interviews revealed 5 major themes: framing obesity in the context of other health problems provided motivation; having a full discussion around weight management was important; an ongoing relationship with the physician was valuable; celebrating small successes was beneficial; and advice was helpful but self-motivation was necessary.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The PCP counseling may be an important factor in promoting weight loss in low-income, African American women. Patients may benefit from their PCPs drawing connections between obesity and weight-related medical conditions and enhancing intrinsic motivation for weight loss. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: The search yielded 130 unique articles, 35 met the inclusion criteria: (1) being conducted in the United States, (2) including an intervention or empirical data around health promotion among adult low-wage workers, and (3) measuring changes in low-wage worker health.<bold>Data Extraction: </bold>Central features of the selected studies were extracted, including the theoretical foundation; study design; health promotion intervention content and delivery format; intervention-targeted outcomes; sample characteristics; and work, occupational, and industry characteristics.<bold>Data Analysis: </bold>Consistent with a scoping review, we used a descriptive, content analysis approach to analyze extracted data. All authors agreed upon emergent themes and 2 authors independently coded data extracted from each article.<bold>Results: </bold>The results suggest that the research on low-wage workers' health promotion is limited, but increasing, and that low-wage workers have limited access to and utilization of worksite health promotion programs.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Workplace health promotion programs could have a positive effect on low-wage workers, but more work is needed to understand how to expand access, what drives participation, and which delivery mechanisms are most effective.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To estimate the prevalence of food insecurity among students at a large mid-Atlantic publicly funded university; examine the association between food insecurity, demographic characteristics, potential financial risk factors, and self-reported physical and mental health and academic performance; and identify possible risk factors for food insecurity.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional survey.<bold>Setting: </bold>Large, public mid-Atlantic university.<bold>Participants: </bold>Two hundred thirty-seven undergraduate students.<bold>Measures: </bold>US Department of Agriculture (USDA) 18-item Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) and questions on demographics, student status, economic factors, housing stability, living arrangements, academic performance, and self-rated physical health and depression symptoms.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariate logistic regression analysis.<bold>Results: </bold>Among students surveyed, 15% were food insecure; an additional 16% were at risk of food insecurity. Students who were African American, other race/ethnicity, receiving multiple forms of financial aid, or experiencing housing problems were more likely to be food insecure or at the risk of food insecurity (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 4.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.83-8.71, P value < .0001; AOR = 5.26, 95% CI = 1.85-14.98, P value = .002; AOR = 3.43, 95% CI = 1.85-6.37, P value <.001; AOR = 8.00, 95% CI = 3.57-17.93, P value < .0001, respectively). Food secure students were less likely to report depression symptoms than at-risk or food insecure students.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Food insecurity among college students is an important public health concern that might have implications for academic performance, retention, and graduation rates. Universities that measure food insecurity among their students will be better positioned to advocate for policy changes at state and federal levels regarding college affordability and student financial assistance.

We tested interactions between 7 baseline perceived environment variables and study condition.<bold>Results: </bold>Neighborhood esthetics was the only significant moderator of intervention effects on accelerometer-based MVPA and self-report leisure-time MVPA. Participants in the PA intervention had significantly higher PA at follow-up than attention control participants, only when participants evaluated their neighborhood esthetics favorably.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Perceived neighborhood esthetics appeared to maximize the effectiveness of a multilevel PA intervention among Latinas. For sustainable PA behavior change, the environments in which Latinas are encouraged to be active may need to be evaluated prior to implementing an intervention to ensure they support active lifestyles.

Fruit and vegetable intake was collected via the Block Fruit-Vegetable-Fiber screener. Participants who self-reported redeeming the WIC CVV in each of the 3 prior months were classified as regular redeemers.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable-adjusted regression models were used to examine associations between variables of interest and regular WIC CVV redemption.<bold>Results: </bold>There were 189 (63.0%) study participants classified as regular WIC CVV redeemers. Regular redeemers and other participants (ie, irregular redeemers and nonredeemers) were similar with respect to demographics. Regular redeemers were more likely to use grocery stores to purchase FVs ( P = .003) and consumed significantly more servings of FVs per day (β = .67; standard error = 0.24; P = .007).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Regular WIC CVV redemption was associated with some produce shopping behaviors and increased FV consumption and among WIC participants in Jefferson County, Alabama.

Children who were recruited actively were significantly more likely to register for the G5AP (OR = 2.444, P < .001).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>To increase the uptake of a PA intervention, children need to be actively recruited. Interactive presentations provide children with increased access to information about both the program and its nuances that cannot be communicated as effectively through passive methods.

Effects on clinical outcomes, as well as interaction effects between incentives, were mixed and generally statistically insignificant.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This study found little to no evidence that these financial incentives had beneficial effects on the incentivized behaviors in this setting. Likewise, the study found no effects on clinical outcomes nor any systematic evidence of interaction effects between 2 and 3 incentives. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>The aims of this analysis were to explore how self-reported barriers to quitting vary by socioeconomic status (SES) among young-adult smokers and to assess their relationship to quitting.<bold>Design: </bold>This analysis uses 2 waves of telephone-survey data from the Minnesota Adolescent Community Cohort study.<bold>Setting: </bold>Midwestern United States.<bold>Participants: </bold>Participants (n = 419) were smokers aged 17 to 24 years.<bold>Measures: </bold>Socioeconomic status was estimated using the highest level of education completed by the participants' parents. Demographics, smoking behavior, and perceived barriers to quitting were collected via survey questions.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Differences in barriers by SES were assessed using prevalence ratios (PRs). Relative risks were calculated to assess the association between barriers and quitting status 1 year later, testing for effect modification by SES.<bold>Results: </bold>Compared to the high SES group (n = 314), the low SES group (n = 105) was more likely to report several barriers to quitting; however, only the risk of gaining weight was significantly more common (PR: 1.38 [1.05-1.83]). There were no significant associations between barriers and quitting status 1 year later, but the number of cigarettes per day was consistently related to the likelihood of quitting 1 year later, regardless of SES.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Despite the limited generalizability to racially diverse populations and different geographic locations, the results suggest perceived barriers may not differ by SES or predict quitting among young adults; however, nicotine dependence may play an important role.

AB- <bold>Objective: </bold>To conduct a systematic literature review to assess the conceptualization, application, and measurement of resilience in American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) health promotion.<bold>Data Sources: </bold>We searched 9 literature databases to document how resilience is discussed, fostered, and evaluated in studies of AIAN health promotion in the United States.<bold>Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: </bold>The article had to (1) be in English; (2) peer reviewed, published from January 1, 1980, to July 31, 2015; (3) identify the target population as predominantly AIANs in the United States; (4) describe a nonclinical intervention or original research that identified resilience as an outcome or resource; and (5) discuss resilience as related to cultural, social, and/or collective strengths.<bold>Data Extraction: </bold>Sixty full texts were retrieved and assessed for inclusion by 3 reviewers. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers and verified for relevance to inclusion criteria by the third reviewer.<bold>Data Synthesis: </bold>Attributes of resilience that appeared repeatedly in the literature were identified. Findings were categorized across the lifespan (age group of participants), divided by attributes, and further defined by specific domains within each attribute.<bold>Results: </bold>Nine articles (8 studies) met the criteria. Currently, resilience research in AIAN populations is limited to the identification of attributes and pilot interventions focused on individual resilience. Resilience models are not used to guide health promotion programming; collective resilience is not explored.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Attributes of AIAN resilience should be considered in the development of health interventions. Attention to collective resilience is recommended to leverage existing assets in AIAN communities. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Characteristics of parents who purchased kids' meals, reasons for the purchase, and desire for healthy options were examined.<bold>Design: </bold>Quantitative, cross-sectional study.<bold>Setting: </bold>National.<bold>Participants: </bold>The SummerStyles survey data of 1147 parents (≥18 years).<bold>Measures: </bold>Self-reported outcome variables were purchase of kids' meals (yes/no), reasons for the purchase (13 choices), and desire for healthy options (yes/no).<bold>Analysis: </bold>We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for purchasing kids' meals based on parental sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics.<bold>Results: </bold>Over half (51%) of parents reported purchasing kids' meals in the past month. The adjusted OR of purchasing kids' meals were significantly higher among younger parents (OR = 3.44 vs ≥50 years) and among parents who consumed sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) daily (OR = 2.70 vs none). No differences were found for race/ethnicity, income, and education. Parents who purchased kids' meals reported that the top 3 reasons for purchase were (1) because their children asked for kids' meals, (2) habit, and (3) offering of healthier sides such as fruits or fruit cups. Thirty-seven percent of parents who did not purchase kids' meals expressed willingness to purchase kids' meals if healthy options were available; this willingness was highest among younger parents (47%; P < .05).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Kids' meal purchases were somewhat common. Our findings on characteristics of parents who frequently bought kids' meals (ie, younger parents and SSB consumers), common reasons for purchasing kids' meals, and willingness to buy healthier kids' meal can be used to inform intervention efforts to improve quality of kids' meals.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>This study details the persuasive message development for a theory-based campaign designed to increase compliance with a university's tobacco-free policy.<bold>Approach: </bold>The theory of planned behavior (TPB) guided message design and evaluation for focus group-tested messages that were adapted to the context of complying with a tobacco-free policy.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study was conducted at a university located in the tobacco belt.<bold>Participants: </bold>Undergraduate focus group participants (n = 65) were mostly male (69%), white (82%), and freshman (62%) who smoked at least 1 cigarette in the last 30 days; on-campus smoking percentages were never/rare (60%), occasionally (23%), and often/frequently (16%).<bold>Method: </bold>Data analysis used a theoretical thematic approach to identify how the TPB constructs related to perceptions of message effectiveness.<bold>Results: </bold>Participants responded favorably to attitudinal strategies about health, respect, and university figures; they rejected approaches they considered juvenile and offensive. They also discussed the impact of noncompliance and avoiding overgeneralized statements for addressing subjective norms, suggesting shortening text, adjusting picture location, and emphasizing the importance of compliance to increase perceptions of behavioral control.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Applying theory to preexisting messages is challenging. The design approach in this study is an evidence-based strategy that can be used as a universal process for message adaptation. Results offer health promotion suggestions for designing messages aimed at improving undergraduate smokers' willingness to comply with tobacco-free campus policies. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine whether meeting sleep guidelines (7-9 hours/night) is associated with better health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and reduced all-cause mortality risk.<bold>Design: </bold>Prospective cohort study.<bold>Setting: </bold>2005 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 13 423 adults.<bold>Measures: </bold>Sleep duration and HRQOL were assessed from self-report; covariates assessed via survey, examination, and laboratory data; and mortality assessed through 2011 via matching from the National Death Index.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Cox proportional hazard regression and ordinal logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>After adjusting for age, gender, race-ethnicity, body mass index, education, smoking, white blood cell level, iron level, red blood cell distribution width, mean platelet volume, blood pressure, diabetes, coronary artery disease, physical activity, and depression, those meeting sleep guidelines had an 19% reduced risk of premature all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-0.99; P = .04). After adjustments, those meeting sleep guidelines had better HRQOL (β = -0.30; 95% CI: -0.38 to -0.21; P < .001). Results for the ordinal regression and Cox proportional analyses were similar in unadjusted and minimally adjusted models.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Obtaining optimal levels of sleep is associated with better HRQOL and reduced premature mortality risk, independent of demographic, behavioral, and biological conditions. These findings underscore the importance of achieving optimal levels of sleep. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>This study assessed whether college student (1) protective behavioral strategy (PBS) use differed between those who reached legal intoxication during their most recent drinking episode compared to those who did not reach the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) threshold, and (2) frequency of PBS use could explain the variance associated with BAC during the most recent drinking episode, above and beyond one's sex, age, and involvement in the Greek system.<bold>Design: </bold>Secondary data analysis of the American College of Health Association's National College Health Assessment.<bold>Setting: </bold>Forty-four distinct campuses were included.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 21479 college students were included.<bold>Measures: </bold>BAC and PBS were measured.<bold>Analysis: </bold>The data were analyzed by conducting both independent samples t-tests and a multiple regression model. Effect sizes are reported.<bold>Results: </bold>Participants who reached legal intoxication used PBS less frequently ( P < .001; d = 0.80). Frequency of PBS use had the strongest unique contribution to the regression model (β = -.315, P < .001), such that participants with higher BAC reported less frequent use of PBS.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Interventions should seek to develop strategies that encourage college student use of PBS prior to, and during, drinking episodes. More frequent use of PBS can reduce intoxication as well as occurrence of alcohol-associated consequences. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Regarding moderate PA, only the interaction between experiential and behavioral POCs was a significant predictor (β = .123; P = .017).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Our results provide confirmation that behavioral processes are most prominent in PA behavior. Nevertheless, it is of interest to note that the interaction between experiential and behavioral POCs was the only element predicting moderate PA level. Experiential processes were not associated with PA level. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Social support was assessed via self-report. Sources evaluated include spouse, son, daughter, sibling, neighbor, church member, and friend. Regarding size of social network, participants were asked, "In general, how many close friends do you have?"<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable linear regression.<bold>Results: </bold>After adjustment, there was no evidence of an association between the size of social support network and sedentary behavior. With regard to specific sources of social support, spousal social support was associated with less sedentary behavior (β = -11.6; 95% confidence interval: -20.7 to -2.5), with evidence to suggest that this was only true for men. Further, an inverse association was observed between household size and sedentary behavior, with those having a greater number of individuals in the house having lower levels of sedentary behavior. These associations occurred independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, age, gender, race-ethnicity, measured body mass index, total cholesterol, self-reported smoking status, and physician diagnosis of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke, cancer, hypertension, or diabetes.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Spouse-specific emotion-related social support (particularly for men) and household size were associated with less sedentary behavior.

Direct mail was the most commonly cited source of cigarette and snus coupons. Tobacco product packaging provided the highest number of tobacco coupons for current and former smokers. Participants without a 4-year college education (compared to those who had a 4-year college education) were more likely to have received coupons for cigarettes and snus and received more coupons for both products ( P < .05). Racial/ethnic minority young adults (vs non-Hispanic white) received more cigarette and snus coupons ( P < .05). Receiving snus coupons was positively associated with susceptibility to snus use ( P < .05).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Tobacco companies are successful in reaching young adults using coupons for various tobacco products. Snus coupons may influence snus use, similar to how cigarette coupons influence smoking. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Approximately 5% had home TSE. Participants who lived with a smoker were significantly more likely to have had a medical care visit (odds ratio [OR] = 1.22, confidence interval [CI] = 1.21-1.22) and were more likely to seek sick care or health advice at an emergency department (OR = 1.23, CI = 1.23-1.24) but were less likely to have had a dental care visit (OR = 0.82, CI = 0.82-0.83) than those who did not live with a smoker. Similar findings were found among participants who had home TSE.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>TSE is a risk factor for increased use of pediatric medical care. Based on the high number of children who potentially had TSE and received sick care or health advice at an emergency emergency department, this setting may be a venue to deliver health messages to caregivers.

Short-form corner store audit tool scores placed stores in the same healthfulness categories as did the adapted NEMS-CS in 88% of the cases. Phone response matches indicated that store owners did not distinguish between 2% and low-fat milk and tended to round up the fruit and vegetable count to 5 if they had fewer varieties.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The SCAT discriminates between higher versus lower healthfulness scores of corner stores and is feasible for use as a phone audit tool.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>We examine the concurrent relationship between obesity incidence and normal weight status incidence and prevalence in children between 9 months and kindergarten.<bold>Design: </bold>Multistage, probability sample from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth cohort.<bold>Setting: </bold>United States.<bold>Participants: </bold>Representative sample of US preschool children (n = 9950) followed from birth through kindergarten.<bold>Measures: </bold>From direct, anthropometric measures, we reported prevalence and incidence rates across 4 follow-up periods.<bold>Analysis: </bold>In addition to prevalence and incidence rates, we reported risk ratios based on multiple definitions and estimated predicted probabilities of obesity and normal weight status using clinically meaningful body mass index (BMI)-for-age percentiles.<bold>Results: </bold>Obesity prevalence (13%-20%) was much smaller than normal weight status prevalence (66%-70%). Lower socioeconomic status, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black children had greater risk of obesity. During 9 months to kindergarten, obesity incidence decreased two-thirds (15.6%), while normal weight status incidence decreased almost one-half (44.6%). Coincidently, normal weight status incidence (ranged from 23% to 45%) was consistently and substantially higher than obesity incidence (ranged from 5% to 15%). During 4 years to kindergarten, the obesity risk for overweight children was 13 times higher than that for normal weight status children.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Overall rates of obese and normal weight incidence were substantial at 9 months, trended lower, but remained high through kindergarten. At 4 years to kindergarten, children with relatively high initial BMI were very likely to become obese but far less likely to achieve normal weight status. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Objective: </bold>The purpose of this investigation was to systematically review work site-based, environmental interventions to reduce sedentary behavior following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines.<bold>Data Source: </bold>Data were extracted from Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science between January 2005 and December 2015.<bold>Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: </bold>Inclusion criteria were work site interventions, published in peer-reviewed journals, employing environmental modalities, targeting sedentary behavior, and using any quantitative design. Exclusion criteria were noninterventions and non-English publications.<bold>Data Extraction: </bold>Data extracted included study design, population, intervention dosage, intervention activities, evaluation measures, and intervention effects.<bold>Data Synthesis: </bold>Data were tabulated quantitatively and synthesized qualitatively.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 15 articles were identified for review and 14 reported statistically significant decreases in sedentary behavior. The majority of studies employed a randomized controlled trial design (n = 7), used inclinometers to measure sedentary behavior (n = 9), recruited predominantly female samples (n = 15), and utilized sit-to-stand desks as the primary intervention modality (n = 10). The mean methodological quality score was 6.2 out of 10.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Environmental work site interventions to reduce sedentary behavior show promise because work sites often have more control over environmental factors. Limitations of this intervention stream include inconsistent measurement of sedentary behavior, absence of theoretical frameworks to guide program development, and absence of long-term evaluation. Future studies should include clear reporting of intervention strategies and explicit operationalization of theoretical constructs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Salad bars were reported by 62% of youth in 2011 and 67% in 2014; the increase was not statistically significant ( P = .07). Significant increases from 2011 to 2014 were noted among youth aged 12 to 14 years (56%-69%; P < .01), youth of non-Hispanic other races (60%-85%; P < .01), and youth in the Midwest (58%-72%; P = .01).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>These results suggest that youth-reported access to school salad bars does not differ significantly across most sociodemographic groups. Although overall salad bar availability did not increase significantly from 2011 to 2014, some increases were observed among subgroups. Continued efforts to promote school salad bars through initiatives such as Let's Move Salad Bars to Schools could help increase access for the nearly one-third of US youth reporting no access.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine locations of secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure among nonsmokers, 7 years after a statewide smoke-free policy.<bold>Design: </bold>Data collected via statewide, random digit dial telephone survey. Response rates were 64.7% for landline and 73.5% for cell phone.<bold>Setting: </bold>Minnesota, 2014.<bold>Participants: </bold>Representative sample of 7887 nonsmoking adults.<bold>Measures: </bold>Self-reported locations of SHS exposure and opinions on smoke-free restrictions.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive statistics and logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 35.5% of nonsmokers reported SHS exposure in the past 7 days. The greatest proportion of exposure occurred in community settings (31.7%) followed by cars (6.9%) and in the home (3.2%). Young adults were more likely to be exposed in a home or car than older adults. Nonsmokers living with a smoker were 39.6 (20.6-75.8) times more likely to be exposed to SHS in their home and 5.3 (4.1-6.8) times more likely to be exposed in a car, compared to those who did not live with a smoker.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>SHS exposure continues after comprehensive smoke-free policies restricted it from public places. Disparities in exposure rates exist for those who live with a smoker, are young, and have low incomes. Findings suggest the need for additional policies that will have the greatest public health benefit. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To test the effects of employer subsidies on employee enrollment, attendance, and weight loss in a nationally available weight management program.<bold>Design: </bold>A randomized trial tested the impact of employer subsidy: 100%; 80%, 50%, and a hybrid 50% subsidy that could become a 100% subsidy by attaining attendance targets.<bold>Trial Registration: </bold>NCT01756066.<bold>Setting and Participants: </bold>Twenty three thousand twenty-three employees of 2 US companies.<bold>Measures: </bold>The primary outcome was the percentage of employees who enrolled in the weight management program. We also tested whether the subsidies were associated with differential attendance and weight loss over 12 months, as might be predicted by the expectation that they attract employees with differing degrees of motivation. Analysis and Results: Enrollment differed significantly by subsidy level ( P < .0001). The 100% subsidy produced the highest enrollment (7.7%), significantly higher than each of the lower subsidies (vs 80% subsidy: 6.2%, P = .002; vs 50% subsidy: 3.9%, P < .0001; vs hybrid: 3.7%, P < .0001). Enrollment in the 80% subsidy group was significantly higher than both lower subsidy groups (vs 50% subsidy: 3.9%, P < .0001; vs hybrid: 3.7%, P < .0001). Among enrollees, there were no differences among the 4 groups in attendance or weight loss.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This pragmatic trial, conducted in a real-world workplace setting, suggests that higher rates of employer subsidization help individuals to enroll in weight loss programs, without a decrement in program effectiveness. Future research could explore the cost-effectiveness of such subsidies or alternative designs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

For example, the "health challenged and hard to reach" are older, lower literacy, and not likely to seek out health information. Their educational and delivery recommendations include a sixth-grade reading level, delivery through a provider, and using a "push" strategy.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This model addresses a need to improve the efficiency and quality of health promotion efforts in an era of personalized medicine. It demonstrates that there are distinct groups with clearly defined educational and delivery recommendations. Health promotion professionals can consider Tailored Educational Approaches for Consumer Health to develop and deliver tailored materials to encourage behavior change. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

No significant differences were found between observers for MVPA ( r = .91, P = .6804) or activity type (κ = .90, P = .6334). Children participated in MVPA during 35.2% of all observations. No significant differences were found for participation in MVPA between boys (37.6%) and girls (32.8%, P = .1589).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The SOPLAY may be a useful tool for measuring MVPA in interactive children's museum exhibitions. Research with multiple museum settings and diverse groups of children over longer periods of time is warranted to further establish the feasibility and reliability of the SOPLAY for measuring MVPA in this novel setting.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Anxiety is the most common and costly mental illness in the United States. Reducing avoidance is a core element of evidence-based treatments. Past research shows readiness to address avoidance affects outcomes. Investigating avoidance from a transtheoretical model (TTM) perspective could facilitate tailored approaches for individuals with low readiness. This study developed and examined psychometric properties of TTM measures for addressing anxiety-based avoidance.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional survey.<bold>Setting: </bold>Community centers, online survey.<bold>Participants: </bold>Five hundred ninety-four individuals aged 18 to 70 with clinically significant anxiety.<bold>Measures: </bold>Overall Anxiety Severity Questionnaire, stages of change, decisional balance, and self-efficacy.<bold>Analysis: </bold>The sample was randomly split into halves for principal component analyses (PCAs) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to test measurement models. Further analyses examined relationships between constructs.<bold>Results: </bold>For decisional balance, PCA indicated two 5-item factors (pros and cons). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a 2-factor correlated model, Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square [Formula: see text], comparative fit index (CFI = 0.94), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA = 0.07), pros: α = 0.87, ρ = 0.87, cons: α = 0.75, and ρ = 0.75. For self-efficacy, PCA indicated one 6-item factor supported by CFA, [Formula: see text], P < .01, CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.09, α = 0.90, ρ = 0.87. As hypothesized, significant cross-stage differences were observed for pros and self-efficacy, and significant relationships between anxiety severity and pros, cons, and self-efficacy were found.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Findings show strong psychometric properties and support the application of a readiness-based model to anxiety. In contrast to findings of other behaviors, cons remain high in action and maintenance. These measures provide a solid empirical foundation to develop TTM-tailored interventions to enhance engagement in treatment. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To collect information that will inform the development of an intervention to support the maintenance of HIV-related health-promoting behaviors.<bold>Design: </bold>Focused, in-depth individual and group interviews.<bold>Setting: </bold>The New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) and DOHMH-funded community-based organizations that primarily serve low-income people living with HIV within the five boroughs of NYC.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 42 individuals who had participated in The Positive Life Workshop-an HIV self-management intervention adapted and implemented by the NYC DOHMH.<bold>Method: </bold>Purposive sampling was used to recruit study participants. Five 60- to 90-minute focus groups (n = 38) and 4 individual interviews were conducted to assess motivations for and barriers to maintaining HIV-related health-promoting behaviors and to elicit feedback on the content and format for the proposed maintenance intervention. Thematic analysis was used to summarize the data.<bold>Results: </bold>Participants reported that relationships with family, a responsibility to protect others from HIV, and faith/spirituality supported the maintenance of health-promoting behaviors. Barriers to behavior maintenance included substance use and mental health issues. Meeting in small groups was also highlighted as a motivator to sustaining health behaviors, particularly in decreasing isolation and receiving affirmation from others.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Participants identified several factors that could be incorporated into an intervention to support HIV-related health-promoting behavior maintenance that could supplement existing HIV self-management interventions.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine the association between smoking and participation in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) among low-income families.<bold>Design: </bold>A quasi-experimental design using pooled cross-sectional data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Diary Survey.<bold>Setting: </bold>A national, representative sample of US households from 2005 through 2012.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 19 395 low-income households.<bold>Measures: </bold>US poverty thresholds were used, in conjunction with household income, to create a sample of families at 130% of the federal poverty level and below. Expenditures on cigarettes and self-reported enrollment in SNAP were used to measure smoking behavior and program participation, respectively.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Estimation of a maximum likelihood model was used to predict the probability of smoking given participation in SNAP.<bold>Results: </bold>The SNAP participation among low-income households was associated with a 30% ( P < .01) increase in the likelihood of a household containing at least 1 smoker, relative to low-income non-SNAP households. Among smokers, SNAP households do not spend more money on tobacco products than non-SNAP households.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Given the strong association found between SNAP participation and smoking, connecting program participants who smoke to effective smoking cessation programs could be an effective tool in reducing the prevalence of smoking among the low-income population. States have a unique opportunity to use SNAP-Education programs to integrate tobacco prevention and cessation into curriculum for direct client impact. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Associations between demographics and missing meals were tested. Associations of lifestyle and dietary behaviors with missing meals were examined using logistic regression controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, and grade.<bold>Results: </bold>In 2010, 63.1% of students missed breakfast, 38.2% missed lunch, and 23.3% missed dinner; the prevalence was highest among female and non-Hispanic black students. Being overweight/obese, perceiving oneself to be overweight, and video game/computer use were associated with increased risk of missing meals. Physical activity behaviors were associated with reduced risk of missing meals. Students who missed breakfast were less likely to eat fruits and vegetables and more likely to consume sugar-sweetened beverages and fast food.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Breakfast was the most frequently missed meal, and missing breakfast was associated with the greatest number of less healthy dietary practices. Intervention and education efforts might prioritize breakfast consumption. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To assess (1) the cumulative effect of socioecological factors (social risk) on objectively measured physical activity, (2) the cumulative socioecological risk on all-cause mortality, (3) the potential interaction effects of social risk factors on physical activity and mortality, and (4) whether physical activity mediates the relationship between social risk and mortality.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional and prospective.<bold>Setting: </bold>Laboratory- and survey-based testing of the general US population.<bold>Participants: </bold>Five thousand five hundred seventy-four adult participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2006.<bold>Measures: </bold>Social risk was assessed from 4 variables, namely poverty level, education, minority status, and social living status. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was assessed via accelerometry. Mortality was assessed via linkage with the National Death Index, with follow-up through 2011.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Negative binomial regression and Cox proportional hazard model.<bold>Results: </bold>Compared to those with 0 social risk factors, those with 1 and 2+ social risk factors engaged in 11% and 10% less MVPA, respectively. Those with 1 (vs 0) social risk factor had a 2.0-fold increase in mortality risk, and those with 2+ (vs 0) social risk factors had a 2.3-fold increase in mortality risk. Interaction effects for various socioecological factors on both MVPA and mortality were observable.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Cumulative social risk is associated with less MVPA and increased all-cause mortality risk. Given the interaction effects of socioecological factors, targeted interventions in identified populations may be needed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

In study 2, trait forgiveness was inversely associated with unproductivity (β = -.20, P = .016) and mental (β = -.31, P < .001) and physical health problems (β = -.28, P = .001), and workplace interpersonal stress partially mediated these associations (indirect effects = -.03, -.04, -.05, respectively).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The association of forgiveness and occupational outcomes is robust. Forgiveness may be associated with outcomes by (at least partially) reducing stress related to workplace offenses.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine the characteristics of voluntary online commitment contracts that may be associated with greater weight loss.<bold>Design: </bold>Retrospective analysis of weight loss commitment contracts derived from a company that provides web-based support for personal commitment contracts. Using regression, we analyzed whether percentage weight loss differed between participants who incentivized their contract using monetary deposits and those who did not.<bold>Setting: </bold>Online.<bold>Participants: </bold>Users (N = 3857) who voluntarily signed up online in 2013 for a weight loss contract.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Participants specified their own weight loss goal, time period, and self-reported weekly weight. Deposits were available in the following 3 categories: charity, anticharity (a nonprofit one does not like), or donations made to a friend.<bold>Measures: </bold>Percentage weight loss per week.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable linear regressions.<bold>Results: </bold>Controlling for several participant and contract characteristics, contracts with anticharity, charity, and friend deposits had greater reported weight loss than nonincentivized contracts. Weight change per week relative to those without deposits was -0.33%, -0.28%, and -0.25% for anti-charity, charity, and friend, respectively ( P < 0.001). Contracts without a weight verification method claimed more weight loss than those with verification.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Voluntary use of commitment contracts may be an effective tool to assist weight loss. Those who choose to use monetary incentives report more weight loss. It is not clear whether this is due to the incentives or higher motivation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>We investigated the associations between frequency of eating at fast-food, fast-casual, all-you-can-eat, and sit-down restaurants and the body mass index (BMI) in non-large metro Wisconsin communities. To inform prevention efforts, we also analyzed the socioeconomic/environmental and nutrition attitudes/behavior variables that may drive the frequent eating away from home.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional analysis of an ancillary data set from the Survey of Health of Wisconsin collected between October 2012 and February 2013.<bold>Setting: </bold>Six Wisconsin counties: 1 classified as rural, 1 as large fringe metro, and 4 as small metro.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Adults ≥18 years (N = 1418).<bold>Measures: </bold>Field staff measured height and weight and administered a survey on the frequency of eating away from home, and socioeconomic and nutritional behavior variables.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable regression.<bold>Results: </bold>The BMI of respondents averaged 29.4 kg/m2 (39% obese). Every 1-meal/week increase in fast-food and sit-down restaurant consumption was associated with an increase in BMI by 0.8 and 0.6 kg/m2, respectively. Unavailability of healthy foods at shopping and eating venues and lack of cooking skills were both positively associated with consumption of fast-food and sit-down meals. Individuals who described their diet as healthy, who avoided high-fat foods, and who believed their diet was keeping their weight controlled did not visit these restaurants frequently.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Obesity prevention efforts in non-large metro Wisconsin communities should consider socioeconomic/environmental and nutritional attitudes/behavior of residents when designing restaurant-based or community education interventions.

AB- Two decades since the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe published a report on health promotion in prison that stimulated further debate on the concept of the "health-promoting prison," this article discusses the extent to which the concept has translated to the United States. One predicted indicator of success for the health-promoting prison movement was the expansion of activity beyond European borders; yet 2 decades since the European model was put forward, there has been very limited activity in the United States. This "Critical Issues and Trends" article suggests reasons why this translation has failed to occur. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- It has been argued that the willpower of our citizenry hasn't measurably changed during the decades in which our nation's waistlines have measurably expanded. I agree, and I'd also submit that a weakening of political willpower and a lack of moral courage among those of us called to leadership is the more disturbing culprit. A case needs to be made that what we know and believe as a profession is most readily measured by what we permit to happen. As you review the sum of the research in this special issue on activity, weight, and diabetes, I anticipate you will share my observation that the current action in health promotion is less about dieting, exercise prescriptions, and chronic condition management and more about the right mix of head, heart, and feet. That is, we are testing the interaction effects of education and attitudes against culture and environment and assessing how the interacting effects of these variables influence motivation and action. This special journal issue shows how great results are occurring in health promotion every day via education and culture change, and it will also bolster your courage to carry on with morality and heart.

Growth curve analysis assessed the impact of HC2 on change in consumption of fruits/vegetables and unhealthy food and PBMI over 2 school years.<bold>Results: </bold>Children in the intervention group (n = 754) had a negative slope (β = -1.95, standard error [SE] = 0.97, P = .04), indicating less increase in PBMI versus control children (n = 457). Stratified analyses showed that obese children in the intervention arm had a significantly higher increase in fruit/vegetable consumption versus control group obese children (β = 0.24, SE = 0.08, P = .003).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The HC2 intervention resulted in the maintenance of healthy PBMI over 2 preschool years among low-income multiethnic children. These findings support efforts to implement healthy weight programs in the childcare setting. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>The study compared perceptions of state legislative aides about tobacco policymaking in states with strong and weak tobacco control policies.<bold>Approach: </bold>Qualitative in-depth interviews carried out in 2009.<bold>Setting: </bold>The US states were ranked on a combination of tobacco prevention funding, taxes, and presence of smoke-free policies. States at the top and bottom of the rankings were chosen.<bold>Participants: </bold>Interviews were conducted with 10 legislative aides in 5 states with strong tobacco control policies and 10 aides in 7 states with weak policies.<bold>Method: </bold>Twenty semistructured interviews were conducted, coded, and analyzed using a consensus coding process.<bold>Results: </bold>Tobacco control was a lower priority in states with weak policies, and respondents from these states listed more barriers to tobacco control policymaking than those from states with strong policies. Successful arguments for tobacco control emphasized operational applications, for example, enhanced revenue from tobacco taxes or safety of children and employees.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Our findings support propositions posited in the Advocacy Coalition Framework. They point to the preeminence of contextual factors, notably political leanings and economic climate on success of policy change efforts. Lessons learned from participants from states with strong policy nonetheless show promise for success in states with weak policy. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

For African American rural youth who experience disparate rates of HIV/sexually transmitted infection, improving caregiver-youth communication about sexual topics may help to reduce risky behaviors. This study assessed the impact of an intervention to improve sexual topic communication.<bold>Design: </bold>A Preintervention-postintervention, quasi-experimental, controlled, and community-based trial.<bold>Setting: </bold>Intervention was in 2 rural North Carolina counties with comparison group in 3 adjacent counties.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Participants (n = 249) were parents, caregivers, or parental figures for African American youth aged 10 to 14.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Twelve-session curriculum for participating dyads.<bold>Measures: </bold>Audio computer-assisted self-interview to assess changes at 9 months from baseline in communication about general and sensitive sex topics and overall communication about sex.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable models were used to examine the differences between the changes in mean of scores for intervention and comparison groups.<bold>Results: </bold>Statistically significant differences in changes in mean scores for communication about general sex topics ( P < .0001), communication about sensitive sex topics ( P < .0001), and overall communication about sex ( P < .0001) existed. Differences in change in mean scores remained significant after adjusting baseline scores and other variables in the multivariate models.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>In Teach One Reach One intervention, adult participants reported improved communication about sex, an important element to support risk reduction among youth in high-prevalence areas.

AB- <bold>Objective: </bold>The study objective was to conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of integrated workplace interventions that combine health promotion with occupational health and safety.<bold>Data Source: </bold>Electronic databases (n = 8), including PsychInfo and MEDLINE, were systematically searched.<bold>Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: </bold>Studies included were those that reported on workplace interventions that met the consensus definition of an "integrated approach," published in English, in the scientific literature since 1990.<bold>Data Extraction: </bold>Data extracted were occupation, worksite, country, sample size, intervention targets, follow-up period, and results reported. Quality was assessed according to American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine Practice Guidelines.<bold>Data Synthesis: </bold>Heterogeneity precluded formal meta-analyses. Results were classified according to the outcome(s) assessed into five categories (health promotion, injury prevention, occupational health and safety management, psychosocial, and return-on-investment). Narrative synthesis of outcomes was performed.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 31 eligible studies were identified; 23 (74%) were (quasi-)experimental trials. Effective interventions were most of those aimed at improving employee physical or mental health. Less consistent results were reported from integrated interventions targeting occupational health and safety management, injury prevention, or organizational cost savings.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Integrated approaches have been posed as comprehensive solutions to complex issues. Empirical evidence, while still emerging, provides some support for this. Continuing investment in, and evaluation of, integrated approaches are worthwhile. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Multivariable models identified male gender and those with an abnormal body mass index were associated with nonparticipation, while having a primary care physician was associated with participation. Very few items showed significant statistical difference in willingness to participate.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Workforce characteristics and access to health care may influence participation in screening and wellness programs. Employment size is not a determining factor for willingness to participate in wellness programs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Our aim is to examine how the attitude toward walking and neighborhood environments interacts to influence walking.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional phone and mail survey.<bold>Setting: </bold>Participants randomly sampled from 6 study sites including Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore, Minneapolis, Manhattan, and Bronx Counties in New York City, and Forsyth and Davidson Counties in North Carolina.<bold>Participants: </bold>The final sample consisted of 2621 persons from 2011 to 2012.<bold>Measures: </bold>Total minutes of walking for travel or leisure, attitude toward walking, and perceptions of the neighborhood environments were self-reported. Street Smart (SS) Walk Score (a measure of walkability derived from a variety of geographic data) was obtained for each residential location.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Linear regression models adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and income.<bold>Results: </bold>Attitude toward walking was positively associated with walking for both purposes. Walking for travel was significantly associated with SS Walk Score, whereas walking for leisure was not. The SS Walk Score and selected perceived environment characteristics were associated with walking in people with a very positive attitude toward walking but were not associated with walking in people with a less positive attitude.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Attitudes toward walking and neighborhood environments interact to affect walking behavior.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Despite evidence demonstrating that health-care providers (HCPs) can effectively promote health behaviors and weight loss among their patients, the extent to which HCPs promote weight loss among overweight and obese adults is not fully understood as the studies on this topic have mostly been conducted in convenience samples. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which HCPs promote weight loss among overweight and obese adults.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional.<bold>Setting: </bold>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2012.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 2291 overweight or obese adults (males 46%, females 54%) of varying racial/ethnic backgrounds.<bold>Measures: </bold>Weight loss/maintenance promotion from HCP was assessed via patient self-report, with weight status assessed via measured body mass index.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive statistics and regression.<bold>Results: </bold>Among those receiving health care in the past 12 months, 19.4% of overweight, 46.8% of obese class 1, 62.8% of obese class 2, and 76.9% of obese class 3 adults were advised to lose/control their weight, and the odds of being advised to control/lose weight by HCP increased accordingly. These results were similar when evaluated across various subpopulations (eg, age, gender). Those who received advice to lose/control weight had 3 times the odds of adopting weight loss/control behaviors (odds ratio = 3.1).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Additional weight loss promotion among overweight and all classes of obese adults is needed from HCP.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>The goal of this research is to examine the extent to which facets of neighborhood sociodemographic contexts influence individual-level physical activity (PA) among youth.<bold>Design: </bold>Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), geographic information systems (GIS), and census data sources, we explicitly test whether built environment factors have differential associations depending on the age and gender of the youth living in urban census tracts.<bold>Setting: </bold>Participants are from the NHANES 2003 to 2006 waves.<bold>Participants: </bold>The study sample for this article was 2706 youth aged 6 to 17 years with valid PA accelerometer measures.<bold>Measures: </bold>A measure of park accessibility was constructed from the 2006 park GIS layer in Environmental System Research Institute ArcGIS 9.3 data. Average daily minutes of moderate to vigorous PA in bouts equal to or longer than 1 minute were recorded using accelerometers over 4 to 7 days.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Analysis was conducted with SAS 9.2, including descriptive analyses and linear regression for PA.<bold>Results: </bold>Findings suggest that built environment features are especially salient for adolescents and youth living in urban areas. Vigorous activity varied by the age and gender of the youth. For example, greater distance to parks is associated with a decrease in PA among girls and boys aged 6 to 11 years. Among teens, distance to parks is significantly associated with decreases in PA among the total sample and among male teens. However, an increase in population density is associated with less time spent in PA among youth aged 6 to 11 years but more PA among teens.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>These analyses represent an important step to considering the implications of modifiable environmental features for youth and contrast with existing literature for adults. Results speak to the efficacy of built environment measures in urban communities and the importance of considering the possibility of differing patterns of associations in childhood and adolescence and by gender. Results from this research inform policy efforts to interdict in the growing trend of youth inactivity in the United States. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Cut points were established for soldiers scoring within the top 33% for each of the 3 Army Physical Fitness Test events (2-mile run, sit-ups, and push-ups) and top 50% in each of the tests combined for overall performance.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals from multivariate analyses were calculated.<bold>Results: </bold>Variables impacting physical fitness performance of men and women included increased body mass index, leading unit PT sessions, and individual distance running mileage. Other variables impacting physical performance for men included increased age, smoking, and individual resistance training.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Soldiers performing additional individual PT demonstrated a positive influence on fitness compared to unit PT participation alone. Increased age and being overweight/obese negatively influenced physical fitness. To enhance fitness performance through unit PT, running by ability groups and resistance training should be encouraged by leadership. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Previous studies have shown that cigarette smoking is associated with higher rates and severity of food insecurity but do not address how population-level smoking rates change in response to changes in food security.<bold>Design: </bold>Trend analysis of serial cross-sectional data.<bold>Setting: </bold>Data from a representative survey of US households.<bold>Participants: </bold>Adults within households participating in both the Food Security Supplement and Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey during 5 overlapping administrations from 1998 to 2011.<bold>Measures: </bold>A "current smoker" is defined as someone who indicated that they currently smoke on "some days" or "every day." A household's food security is coded as "secure" or "insecure," according to responses to a food security scale, interpreted using a US Department of Agriculture standard.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive comparison of the roughly triennial trends in the prevalence of food insecurity and current smoking from 1998 to 2011.<bold>Results: </bold>The prevalence of food insecurity increased by 30% among adults overall versus 54% among current smokers, with most of the changes occurring following the economic recession of 2008 and 2009. Over this same period, the prevalence of current smoking declined by 33% among food-secure adults and only 14% among food-insecure adults.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Food insecurity increased more markedly among adult smokers than nonsmokers, and the prevalence of smoking declined more slowly in food-insecure households, indicating that more low-income smokers are facing hunger, which may at least partly be due to buying cigarettes.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine psychometric properties of a Commitment to Physical Activity Scale for Adolescents (CPASA).<bold>Design: </bold>Two test-retest studies and a prospective study, approved by a university institutional review board, were conducted in midwestern U.S. urban areas.<bold>Setting: </bold>The first test-retest study occurred in four community centers, the second test-retest study took place in a community school, and the prospective study occurred in eight middle schools.<bold>Subjects: </bold>To measure commitment at baseline and 1 week later, 51 girls in the first test-retest study completed an original 26-item scale, and 91 in the second test-retest study completed a revised 11-item scale. In the prospective study, 503 girls completed the 11-item scale.<bold>Measures: </bold>Commitment was measured via the CPASA. After completing the CPASA, girls in the prospective study wore ActiGraph GT3X-plus accelerometers that measured light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity (LMVPA) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were estimated. Both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted to cross-validate the factor structure.<bold>Results: </bold>For the 11-item CPASA, Cronbach α ranged from .81 to .82, and test-retest reliability was .88. Both EFA and CFA indicated a single factor. The scale was significantly correlated with LMVPA (r = .10) and MVPA (r = .11).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The 11-item CPASA demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity with girls.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To examine the reach, efficacy, and adoption of The Bigger Picture, a type 2 diabetes (T2DM) social marketing campaign that uses spoken-word public service announcements (PSAs) to teach youth about socioenvironmental conditions influencing T2DM risk.<bold>Design: </bold>A nonexperimental pilot dissemination evaluation through high school assemblies and a Web-based platform were used.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study took place in San Francisco Bay Area high schools during 2013.<bold>Subjects: </bold>In the study, 885 students were sampled from 13 high schools.<bold>Intervention: </bold>A 1-hour assembly provided data, poet performances, video PSAs, and Web-based platform information. A Web-based platform featured the campaign Web site and social media.<bold>Measures: </bold>Student surveys preassembly and postassembly (knowledge, attitudes), assembly observations, school demographics, counts of Web-based utilization, and adoption were measured.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive statistics, McNemar's χ2 test, and mixed modeling accounting for clustering were used to analyze data.<bold>Results: </bold>The campaign included 23 youth poet-created PSAs. It reached >2400 students (93% self-identified non-white) through school assemblies and has garnered >1,000,000 views of Web-based video PSAs. School participants demonstrated increased short-term knowledge of T2DM as preventable, with risk driven by socioenvironmental factors (34% preassembly identified environmental causes as influencing T2DM risk compared to 83% postassembly), and perceived greater personal salience of T2DM risk reduction (p < .001 for all). The campaign has been adopted by regional public health departments.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The Bigger Picture campaign showed its potential for reaching and engaging diverse youth. Campaign messaging is being adopted by stakeholders. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>We combined data from the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection (NBCCEDP) and Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) programs in South Carolina to assess whether cancer screening outcomes in NBCCEDP impacted participation in WISEWOMAN lifestyle interventions, and whether the status of WISEWOMAN baseline risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and smoking) determined subsequent completion of lifestyle interventions.<bold>Design: </bold>Case-control.<bold>Setting: </bold>Three WISEWOMAN implementation sites in South Carolina.<bold>Subjects: </bold>The study comprised 7841 NBCCDEP participants in three WISEWOMAN program sites. The two programs serve financially disadvantaged women.<bold>Measures: </bold>Outcome measures were participation in WISEWOMAN lifestyle interventions and completion of lifestyle interventions. The main predictor measures were cancer screening outcomes and baseline chronic disease risk factors. Covariate measures included age, race, body mass index, smoking status, and education.<bold>Analysis: </bold>We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine the odds of participation in and completion of WISEWOMAN lifestyle interventions.<bold>Results: </bold>The association between cancer screening outcome and participation in WISEWOMAN lifestyle interventions among NBCCEDP participants differed significantly by education and smoking status. Among smokers or highly educated women, having an outcome of cancer or precancerous lesion through the NBCCEDP screening compared to normal screening outcomes was significantly associated with participation in lifestyle interventions, with odds ratios of 2.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-6.58) for highly educated women and 1.82 (95% CI, 1.00-3.31) for smokers. Similarly, smokers or diabetics were more likely than nonsmokers or nondiabetics, respectively, to complete lifestyle interventions.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Nonsmokers and women with lower education in NBCCEDP may need additional navigation to lifestyle interventions in an integrated program implementation approach to improve participation in and completion of WISEWOMAN interventions.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To compare cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors of black and non-black children participating in Project Healthy Schools (PHS), a school-based wellness program.<bold>Design: </bold>Participants were surveyed and participated in physiological screenings pre- and post-PHS intervention.<bold>Setting: </bold>Middle schools in 4 Michigan communities of varying socioeconomic status.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 3813 sixth-grade students comprised the survey sample, and 2297 sixth-grade students comprised the screening sample.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Project Healthy Schools is a school-based intervention designed to reduce the risk of obesity and CVD in children through the promotion of healthy eating and physical activity.<bold>Measures: </bold>Physical examination, blood test, and self-reported survey data on dietary habits, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors were collected pre- and post-PHS.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Paired and independent t tests were used for physiologic variables. Wilcoxon sign-rank and rank-sum tests were used for survey variables.<bold>Results: </bold>At baseline, blacks had a higher percentage of overweight/obese students (43% vs 34%; P < .0001) and demonstrated poorer health habits than non-blacks; however, non-blacks had poorer lipid profiles. At follow-up (post-PHS intervention), both groups demonstrated significant improvements in physiological measures and health behaviors.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Despite disparities between the groups at both baseline and follow-up, changes seen post-PHS intervention were beneficial in both groups. These results suggest that early intervention for risk factor modification is possible and may be of great importance in the prevention of CVD, particularly in high-risk groups. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

One model predicted the likelihood of believing PHIM systems would positively affect overall health and willingness to use. Another predicted the likelihood of worrying about online security and not believing PHIM systems would benefit health goals.<bold>Results: </bold>Based on 333 responses, believing PHIM systems would positively affect health was highly associated with willingness to use PHIM systems (p < .01). Those comfortable online were 7.22 times more willing to use PHIM systems. Participants in exercise-based components of WWPs were 3.03 times more likely to be willing to use PHIM systems. Those who worried about online security were 5.03 times more likely to believe PHIM systems would not help obtain health goals.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Comfort with personal health information online and exercise-based WWP experience was associated with willingness to use PHIM systems. However, nutrition-based WWPs did not have similar effects. Implementation barriers relate to technology anxiety and trust in security, as well as experience with specific WWP activities. Identifying differences between WWP components and addressing technology concerns before implementation of PHIM systems into WWPs may facilitate improved adoption and usage. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Water pipe tobacco smoking (WTS) is growing in popularity among U.S. young adults and is associated with health risks similar to those of cigarette smoking. The purpose of this study is to examine existing tobacco control policies (TCPs) in order to investigate how they engage WTS.<bold>Approach: </bold>A systematic synthesis of content and legal interactions among federal, state, and local TCP documents.<bold>Setting: </bold>Pennsylvania, which represents a politically and demographically diverse microcosm of the United States.<bold>Participants: </bold>No human subjects.<bold>Method: </bold>Federal and state TCPs were retrieved via public legal repositories. Local policy searches were conducted via county/municipal Web sites, inclusive of 13 localities that had autonomous health departments or existing TCPs based on a National Cancer Institute report. Full-text TCPs were double coded within a grounded theory framework for health policy analysis. Emergent codes were used to compare and contrast policy texts and to examine legal interactions among TCPs.<bold>Results: </bold>Examination of policy categories including youth access, use restrictions, and taxation revealed WTS as largely omitted from current TCPs. WTS was sometimes addressed as an "other" tobacco product under older TCPs, though ambiguities in language led to questionable enforceability. State preemptions have rolled back or prevented well-tailored reforms at the local level. Federal preemptions have likewise constrained state TCPs.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Outdated, preempted, and unclear policies limit the extent to which TCPs engage WTS. Health advocates might target these aspects of TCP reform. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To investigate whether changes in physical activity (PA) have an impact on sedentary behavior (SB) during a lifestyle intervention.<bold>Design: </bold>Study design was a randomized trial.<bold>Setting/subjects: </bold>Participants (n = 204) were individuals with low PA and high sedentary leisure screen time from the Chicago area.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Participants were randomized to either increase PA (iPA) or decrease sedentary leisure (dSED). The intervention consisted of decision support, coaching, and financial incentives. For iPA participants, the goal was at least 60 min/d of self-reported moderate-tovigorous-intensity PA (MVPA). For dSED participants the goal was less than 90 min/d of sedentary leisure screen time.<bold>Measures: </bold>Daily accelerometer-based measures of SB and bout-corrected MVPA were obtained.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Linear mixed-effects models were fit to estimate the effect of the intervention on MVPA and total SB and to estimate the effect of daily changes in MVPA on daily SB.<bold>Results: </bold>The iPA participants increased their bout-corrected MVPA by 14 min/d (p < .001) and decreased their total SB by 18 min/d (p < .001). The dSED participants did not significantly change their PA or their total SB. On days when participants exercised, each 10-minute bout of MVPA was associated with a 6-minute decrease in SB on the same day (p < .001).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In an intervention study designed to increase MVPA, participants who increase their time spent exercising will obtain much of this time by reducing their SB.

The waist circumference (cm) and the body mass index (weight in kilogram divided by height in meter squared) as a marker for obesity. Smoking, drinking, and physical activity as main independent variables.<bold>Analysis: </bold>A multivariate logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>Nonobese patients, as based on the waist circumference, were more likely to adhere to their medication (by 8.9% for hypertension, 6.2% for diabetes, and 3.5% for hyperlipidemia). Current smokers were less likely to adhere to their medication (by 8.7% for hypertension and 6.8% for diabetes), and moderate and heavy drinkers were also less likely to show medication adherence for diabetes (by 12.9% and 6.4%). Mild physical activity was related to a 1.1% to 1.8% increase in the likelihood of medication adherence across the three disease groups.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Health promotion programs for self-care health behaviors of elderly patients should emphasize good medication adherence to achieve successful self-management of diseases.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Physical activity (PA) has previously been demonstrated to be inversely related with multimorbidity (having more than one chronic disease); however, it is unknown whether dual participation in both PA and muscle-strengthening activities (MSA) may further reduce the odds of being multimorbid. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to determine the association between multimorbidity and individuals meeting recommended guidelines for both PA and MSA.<bold>Design: </bold>Nonexperimental.<bold>Setting: </bold>The 2003-2006 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Four thousand five hundred eighty-seven adults aged ≥20 years.<bold>Measures: </bold>Accelerometry-measured PA, self-reported MSA, and multimorbidity.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Data were analyzed using multivariable linear and logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>The odds (95% confidence interval) of being multimorbid for those only meeting MSA guidelines, only meeting PA guidelines, and meeting both PA and MSA guidelines (vs. not meeting either), respectively, were .69 (.48, .98; p = .04), .55 (.44, .70; p < .01), and .38 (.27, .53; p < .01).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Our findings demonstrate that individuals meeting recommended guidelines for both MSA and PA were less likely to be multimorbid than individuals participating in one or none of these exercise modalities. Determining effective ways to initiate and maintain concurrent adoption of MSA and PA is needed to provide a cost-effective behavioral alternative for reducing the prevalence of multimorbidity.

SU- CONSEQUENTIALISM (Ethics)
AB- Health promotion is complex even when issues of justice and equity are not considered. The dynamic influences of culture, environments, education and upbringing all collude to make promoting fitness, happiness or healthy eating as exciting and unpredictable as a Mars mission. Add the goal of equivalence of benefit for all to this mix, and the launch pad is ever more volatile. To solve for parity we will need to struggle between two of the most time-honored of moral principles. Consequentialism holds that, as Star Trek's Dr. Spock said with his dying breath in his final episode, "the needs of the many are more important than the needs of a few." Categorical reasoning is a belief system where some things are morally righteous no matter the context. Choosing the right principles will require that we better leverage "citizen scientists" because one of the surest ways to satisfy a community's context is to recruit community partners.

AB- If you ask most health professionals why they do what they do, they invariably speak of being of service. And being of service, for population health workers, becomes ever more meaningful as our work touches ever more lives. To wit, "Kaizen," a Japanese term meaning "change for better," sits shoulder to shoulder with our life's purpose. Health promotion professionals are high performers getting great results but we need to start working on our work. What would it take to increase our impact by 50%? And when we change our processes to accomplish that, what would we change next to get another 50% improvement? Only by stepping back and examining our processes can we see the time and motion required to make what's working now work better and be more accessible to more people next time. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

We used a directed content analysis approach to analyze the focus group transcripts.<bold>Results: </bold>Clients in facilities with outdoor restrictions on smoking had stronger perceived antitobacco norms than those in facilities without such restrictions. We identified the following major themes: attitudes toward smoke-free policies, the use of e-cigarettes, the addictive potential of cigarettes, vulnerability to tobacco industry marketing, and interest in smoking cessation. The consensus was that smoke-free policies were important because they limited secondhand smoke exposure to nonsmokers and children. All were curious about e-cigarettes, particularly if they could be smoked in areas where smoking was prohibited and/or used as a cessation aid.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In this study of homeless adults, there was strong support for indoor and outdoor smoke-free policies. However, misperceptions that e-cigarettes could be used indoors could threaten antitobacco norms, highlighting opportunities to educate about the potential risks of e-cigarette use among homeless individuals.

We used these strategies as key words to search for laws authorizing WHP programs or select WHP elements. We calculated the number and type of WHP elements for each state with WHP laws and selected two case examples from states with comprehensive WHP laws.<bold>Results: </bold>Twenty-four states authorized onsite WHP programs, 29 authorized WHP through employer-provided insurance plans, and 18 authorized both. Seven states had a comprehensive WHP strategy, addressing 8 or more of 12 HSC elements. The most common HSC elements were weight management, tobacco cessation, and physical activity.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Most states had laws encouraging the adoption of WHP programs. Massachusetts and Maine are implementing comprehensive WHP laws but studies evaluating their health impact are needed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>China has a high prevalence of smoking, but the characteristics of social smoking in Chinese college students have not been investigated. We examined the pattern of social smoking and explored the association between social smoking and personal cessation efforts and mental health factors among Chinese male college students.<bold>Design: </bold>Study design was a cross-sectional survey.<bold>Setting: </bold>P. R. China was the setting of the study.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Participants were a random sample of 1327 male college students.<bold>Measures: </bold>All participants completed a self-administered questionnaire that examined their smoking behaviors and a group of specific mental health factors (loneliness, self-harm, suicide, depression, and anxiety).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, χ2 analysis, and multivariate logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>Of a total of 207 current smokers, 102 (49.3%) were identified as social smokers. Compared with nonsmokers, social smokers had increased risks for depression (odds ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.65). Among daily smokers, social smokers were less likely to have an intention to quit smoking than nonsocial smokers (odds ratio, .08; 95% confidence interval, .01-.57).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This study reveals unique psychologic characteristics related to social smoking. College students are a particular group of interest because unhealthy behaviors initiated during adolescence may continue through adulthood. Our findings provide evidence for future tobacco control intervention among this population. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a text message-based smoking cessation intervention in China.<bold>Design: </bold>Study design was a randomized control trial with a 6-month follow-up assessment of smoking status.<bold>Setting: </bold>Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, and Shaanxi provinces in China provided the study setting.<bold>Subjects: </bold>A total of 8000 adult smokers in China who used Nokia Life Tools and participated in phase 2 (smoking education via text message) of the study were included.<bold>Intervention: </bold>The high-frequency text contact (HFTC) group received one to three messages daily containing smoking cessation advice, encouragement, and health education information. The low-frequency text contact (LFTC) group received one weekly message with smoking health effects information.<bold>Measures: </bold>Our primary outcome was smoking status at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months after intervention. Secondary outcomes include participant perceptions of the HFTC intervention, and factors associated with smoking cessation among HFTC participants.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive and χ2 analyses were conducted to assess smoking status and acceptability. Factors associated with quitting were assessed using multiple logistic regression analyses.<bold>Results: </bold>Quit rates were high in both the HFTC and LFTC groups (HFTC: 0 month, 27.9%; 1 month, 30.5%; 3 months, 26.7%; and 6 months, 27.7%; LFTC: 0 month, 26.7%; 1 month, 30.4%; 3 months, 28.1%; and 6 months, 27.7%), with no significant difference between the two groups in an intent-to-treat analysis. Attitudes toward the HFTC intervention were largely positive.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Our findings suggest that a text message-based smoking cessation intervention can be successfully delivered in China and is acceptable to Chinese smokers, but further research is needed to assess the potential impact of this type of intervention.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Evaluate the perceived effectiveness of key antismoking messages among highly disadvantaged smokers and assess the impact of nicotine dependence and cessation cognitions on message processing.<bold>Design: </bold>The experimental crossover trial, undertaken between March and December 2012, randomly exposed participants to two of three antismoking advertisements delivered via touchscreen computer.<bold>Setting: </bold>Welfare recipients were recruited from a community service organization in New South Wales, Australia.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Subjects were 354 smokers (79% response rate). Participants resided in government rental housing (52%), earned less than AUD$400/wk (72%), and received their primary income from government welfare (95%).<bold>Intervention: </bold>Three 30-second antismoking television advertisements representing common campaign themes: why to quit (graphic imagery), why to quit (personal testimonial), or how to quit.<bold>Measures: </bold>An 11-item scale assessed perceived effectiveness and message acceptance. An eight-item cessation cognitions index assessed motivations and readiness to quit, and the heaviness of smoking index was used to classify nicotine dependence.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive statistics, generalized linear mixed models, and multiple linear regression analyses are reported.<bold>Results: </bold>Why-to-quit advertisements were perceived as significantly more effective than the how-to-quit advertisement (all p < .0001). Smokers with positive cessation cognitions were more likely to accept antismoking messages (p = .0003) and perceive them as effective (p < .0001). Nicotine dependence level did not influence message acceptance (p = .7322) or effectiveness (p = .8872).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Highly emotive advertisements providing good reasons to quit may be the most effective in promoting the antismoking message among groups with high smoking rates.

Other common themes were identified.<bold>Results: </bold>More than half (54%) of the tweets normalized marijuana and alcohol (without preferring one substance over the other), and 24% preferred marijuana over alcohol. Only 2% expressed a preference for alcohol over marijuana, 7% discouraged the use of both substances, and the sentiment was unknown for 13% of the tweets. Common themes among tweets that normalized both substances included using the substances with friends (17%) and mentioning substance use in the context of sex or romance (14%). Common themes among tweets that preferred marijuana over alcohol were the beliefs that marijuana is safer than alcohol (46%) and preferences for effects of marijuana over alcohol (40%).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Tweets normalizing polysubstance use or encouraging marijuana use over alcohol use are common. Both online and offline prevention efforts are needed to increase awareness of the risks associated with polysubstance use and marijuana use. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

This study describes the existing health promotion environment and its relationship to church member behavior.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional.<bold>Setting: </bold>Data were obtained from parishioners of six churches in predominantly rural South Georgia.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Participants were 319 church members with average age of 48 years, of whom 80% were female and 84% were black/African-American.<bold>Measures: </bold>Questionnaires assessed perceptions of the existing church health promotion environment relative to nutrition and physical activity, eating behavior and intention to use physical activity facilities at church, and eating and physical activity behaviors outside of church.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multiple regression and ordinal logistic regression using generalized estimating equations were used to account for clustered data.<bold>Results: </bold>Results indicate that delivering messages via sermons and church bulletins, having healthy eating programs, and serving healthy foods are associated with participants' self-reported consumption of healthy foods at church (all p values ≤ .001). Serving more healthy food and less unhealthy food was associated with healthier eating in general but not to physical activity in general (p values ≤ .001).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The church environment may play an important role in supporting healthy eating in this setting and more generally.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>The association between short sleep and obesity risk is well established. However, we explore a new pathway between short sleep and obesity: whether short sleep is linked to more time spent in secondary eating or drinking, that is, eating or drinking (beverages other than water, such as sugar-sweetened beverages) while primarily engaged in another activity, such as television watching.<bold>Design: </bold>This pooled cross-sectional study uses data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) from 2006 to 2008.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study takes place in the United States.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Subjects are 28,150 adults (55.8% female) aged 21 to 65 who were surveyed in the ATUS.<bold>Measures: </bold>Outcomes are time spent on (1) secondary eating and drinking and (2) primary eating and drinking. Our main predictor variable is sleep duration.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents, we estimate multivariate regression-analysis models for the full sample, as well as by weekday/weekend status, race, and gender subgroups.<bold>Results: </bold>In multivariate models, compared to respondents reporting normal sleep, short sleep was associated with additional 8.7 (SE = 2.1) minutes per day of secondary eating (p < .01) and additional 28.6 (SE = 4.2) and 31.28 (SE = 5.0) minutes per day of secondary drinking on weekdays and weekends, respectively (p < .01).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>We find that short sleep is associated with more time spent in secondary eating and, in particular, secondary drinking. This potentially suggests a pathway from short sleep to increased caloric intake in the form of beverages and distracted eating and thus potential increased obesity risk, although more research is needed.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is high among U.S. adults and is associated with obesity. Given that more than 100 million Americans consume food or beverages at work daily, the worksite may be a venue for interventions to reduce SSB consumption. However, the level of support for these interventions is unknown. We examined associations between workday SSB intake and employees' support for worksite wellness strategies (WWSs).<bold>Design: </bold>We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from Web-based annual surveys that gather information on health-related attitudes and behaviors.<bold>Setting: </bold>Study setting was the United States.<bold>Subjects: </bold>A total of 1924 employed adults (≥18 years) selected using probability-based sampling.<bold>Measures: </bold>The self-reported independent variable was workday SSB intake (0, <1 or ≥1 times per day), and dependent variables were employees' support (yes/no) for the following WWSs: (1) accessible free water, (2) affordable healthy food/drink, (3) available healthy options, and (4) less available SSB.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable logistic regression was used to control for sociodemographic variables, employee size, and availability of cafeteria/vending machine.<bold>Results: </bold>About half of employees supported accessible free water (54%), affordable healthy food/drink (49%), and available healthy options (46%), but only 28% supported less available SSB. Compared with non-SSB consumers, daily SSB consumers were significantly less supportive of accessible free water (adjusted odds ratio, .67; p < .05) or less available SSB (odds ratio, .49; p < .05).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Almost half of employees supported increasing healthy options within worksites, although daily workday SSB consumers were less supportive of certain strategies. Lack of support could be a potential barrier to the successful implementation of certain worksite interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Many Americans continue to smoke, increasing their risk of disease and premature death. Both telephone-based counseling and in-person tobacco cessation classes may improve access for smokers seeking convenient support to quit. Little research has assessed whether such programs are effective in real-world clinical populations.<bold>Design: </bold>Retrospective cohort study comparing wellness coaching participants with two groups of controls.<bold>Setting: </bold>Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care delivery system.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Two hundred forty-one patients who participated in telephonic tobacco cessation coaching from January 1, 2011, to March 31, 2012, and two control groups: propensity-score-matched controls, and controls who participated in a tobacco cessation class during the same period. Wellness coaching participants received an average of two motivational interviewing-based coaching sessions that engaged the patient, evoked their reason to consider quitting, and helped them establish a quit plan.<bold>Measures: </bold>Self-reported quitting of tobacco and fills of tobacco cessation medications within 12 months of follow-up.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Logistic regressions adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and primary language.<bold>Results: </bold>After adjusting for confounders, tobacco quit rates were higher among coaching participants vs. matched controls (31% vs. 23%, p < .001) and comparable to those of class attendees (31% vs. 29%, p = .28). Coaching participants and class attendees filled tobacco-cessation prescriptions at a higher rate (47% for both) than matched controls (6%, p < .001).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Telephonic wellness coaching was as effective as in-person classes and was associated with higher rates of quitting compared to no treatment. The telephonic modality may increase convenience and scalability for health care systems looking to reduce tobacco use and improve health. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To compare two intensity levels (standard vs. enhanced) of a nutrition and physical activity intervention vs. a control (usual programs) on nutrition knowledge, body mass index, fitness, academic performance, behavior, and medication use among elementary school students.<bold>Design: </bold>Quasi-experimental with three arms.<bold>Setting: </bold>Elementary schools, students' homes, and a supermarket.<bold>Subjects: </bold>A total of 1487 third-grade students.<bold>Intervention: </bold>The standard intervention (SI) provided daily physical activity in classrooms and a program on making healthful foods, using food labels. The enhanced intervention (EI) provided these plus additional components for students and their families.<bold>Measures: </bold>Body mass index (zBMI), food label literacy, physical fitness, academic performance, behavior, and medication use for asthma or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable generalized linear model and logistic regression to assess change in outcome measures.<bold>Results: </bold>Both the SI and EI groups gained less weight than the control (p < .001), but zBMI did not differ between groups (p = 1.00). There were no apparent effects on physical fitness or academic performance. Both intervention groups improved significantly but similarly in food label literacy (p = .36). Asthma medication use was reduced significantly in the SI group, and nonsignificantly (p = .10) in the EI group. Use of ADHD medication remained unchanged (p = .34).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The standard intervention may improve food label literacy and reduce asthma medication use in elementary school children, but an enhanced version provides no further benefit.

U.K. hospital workplace.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Two hundred ninety-six employees (19-67 years, 53% of study Web site visitors).<bold>Intervention: </bold>Twelve-week messaging intervention designed to increase physical activity and delivered via SMS (n =147) or e-mail (n =149); content tailored using theory of planned behavior (TPB) and limited to 160 characters.<bold>Measures: </bold>Baseline and 6, 12, and 16 weeks. Online measures included TPB constructs, physical activity behavior on the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, and health-related quality of life on the Short-Form 12.<bold>Analysis: </bold>General linear models for repeated measures.<bold>Results: </bold>Increase in duration (mean h/d) of moderate work-related activity and moderate recreational activity from baseline to 16 weeks. Short-lived increase in frequency (d/wk) of vigorous recreational activity from baseline to 6 weeks. Increase in duration and frequency of active travel from baseline to 16 weeks. E-mails generated greater changes than SMS in active travel and moderate activity (work and recreational).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Minimal physical activity promotion delivered by SMS or e-mail can increase frequency and duration of active travel and duration of moderate intensity physical activity at work and for leisure, which is maintained up to 1 month after messaging ends. Both channels were useful platforms for health communication; e-mails were particularly beneficial with hospital employees. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- This article presents and interprets the strong evidence that helping others in meaningful ways generally results in a happier, healthier, resilient, and even longer life for the giver; based on the strength of this evidence overall and in subpopulations including patient groups, it then asserts that the time has come for health-care professionals to prescribe and recommend such behavior at sustainable levels generally in the range of 2 hours per week. The medical evidence justifies the prescribing (or recommending) of volunteerism and helping activities for individuals, schools, companies, and whole communities. This article presents this innovative claim against the backdrop Norman Rockwell's iconic image of The Golden Rule (1961), in which he captures the benefits of focusing our minds and actions on contributing to the lives of others. The review encompasses all age groups, many special categories of people grappling with illness, and population health generally. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics benchmarks as a framework, this study examined childcare providers' (Head Start [HS], Child and Adult Care Food Program [CACFP] funded, and non-CACFP) perspectives regarding communicating with parents about nutrition to promote children's health.<bold>Design: </bold>Qualitative.<bold>Setting: </bold>State-licensed center-based childcare programs.<bold>Participants: </bold>Full-time childcare providers (n = 18) caring for children 2 to 5 years old from varying childcare contexts (HS, CACFP funded, and non-CACFP), race, education, and years of experience.<bold>Methods: </bold>In-person interviews using semi-structured interview protocol until saturation were achieved. Thematic analysis was conducted.<bold>Results: </bold>Two overarching themes were barriers and strategies to communicate with parents about children's nutrition. Barriers to communication included-(a) parents are too busy to talk with providers, (b) parents offer unhealthy foods, (c) parents prioritize talking about child food issues over nutrition, (d) providers are unsure of how to communicate about nutrition without offending parents, and (e) providers are concerned if parents are receptive to nutrition education materials. Strategies for communication included-(a) recognize the benefits of communicating with parents about nutrition to support child health, (b) build a partnership with parents through education, (c) leverage policy (federal and state) to communicate positively and avoid conflict, (d) implement center-level practices to reinforce policy, and (e) foster a respectful relationship between providers and parents.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Policy and environmental changes were recommended for fostering a respectful relationship and building a bridge between providers and parents to improve communication about children's nutrition and health.

AB- The kind of engagement industrial psychologists have shown can produce optimal performance relates more to a state of mind than to increasing participation in programs or motivating a workforce with financial incentives. In the context of quality improvement methodologies, the health promotion profession has yet to discover when, where and how large financial incentives should be and how they best fit in our processes. That is, there is no "standard work" for the use of extrinsic motivators. Yet, to argue against incentives given evidence to date has more to do with polemics than science. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

This editorial argues that CQI principles are closely related to the goal of this journal to advance best practices in health promotion. To this end, contributors of articles are called on to write a discussion section that offers soaring insights alongside practical takeaways for our readers. Unlike other sections of an article, the discussion section is where scientists should feel emboldened to speculate, admit surprises, and muse about possible cause and effect relationships they found gratifying or troubling. The discussion section is our window into how today's best practices are informing next practices or are about to be supplanted by a better idea. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a real-time self-report strategy, to examine (1) whether dog owners were more likely to be physically active when they were with their dogs and (2) whether being with a dog amplifies positive and dampens negative affective response during physical activity.<bold>Design: </bold>Electronic EMA surveys for 12 days.<bold>Setting: </bold>Free-living.<bold>Participants: </bold>Seventy-one adult dog owners.<bold>Measures: </bold>The EMA survey included 1 question about current activity, 3 questions about positive affect (Cronbach α = .837), 4 questions about negative affect (Cronbach α = .865), and 1 question about the presence of dog.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multilevel modeling.<bold>Results: </bold>The company of a dog did not increase the likelihood of being active versus sedentary at any given EMA prompt. However, greater positive affect during physical activity was reported in the company of a dog. Negative affect did not differ between active and sedentary activity, regardless of being with a dog or not.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This study demonstrates the utility of electronic EMA as a promising methodology to study dog-accompanied physical activity. Future studies may use EMA to collect further contextual information about dog-accompanied activity to inform the development of innovative physical activity interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Interest and funding continue to grow for bringing supermarkets to underserved areas, yet little is known about their impact.<bold>Design: </bold>A quasi-experimental study was used to determine the impact of a new supermarket opening as a result of tax and zoning incentives.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study took place in the South Bronx, New York City, New York.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Studied were residents of two South Bronx neighborhoods deemed high need.<bold>Measures: </bold>Food purchasing and consumption were examined via surveys and 24-hour dietary recalls before and at two points after the supermarket opened (1-5, 13-17 months).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Data were analyzed using difference-in-difference models controlling for gender, race and ethnicity, age, education, marital status, and self-reported income. Ordinary least squares and logistic regression models were estimated for continuous and binary outcomes, respectively.<bold>Results: </bold>At baseline, 94% to 97% of consumers shopped at a supermarket. There was a 2% increase in this behavior in the intervention community ( p < .05) not seen in the comparison community. One year later there was a 7% net increase in eating at home ( p < .1) and a 20% decrease in drinking sugary beverages ( p < .05), but no appreciable change in fruit/vegetable consumption or overall dietary quality.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The new supermarket did not result in substantial or broad changes in purchasing patterns or nutritional quality of food consumed, though smaller, positive changes were observed over a 1-year period. Future work should examine different contexts and a broader set of outcomes, including economic development. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Employers are increasingly exploring health benefits that incentivize lifestyle change for employees. We used early data from an ongoing study of one such model-the Health Engagement Model (HEM), which Oregon implemented for all public employees in 2012-to analyze variation in employee participation and engagement.<bold>Design: </bold>A survey was designed to assess program engagement, opinions of the program, and self-reported lifestyle changes.<bold>Setting: </bold>Data were collected in 2012, about 9 months after HEM launched.<bold>Subjects: </bold>A representative random sample of 4500 state employees served as the study subjects.<bold>Measures: </bold>Primary measures included whether employees signed up for the program, completed its required activities, and reported making lifestyle changes.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Logistic regression was used to analyze survey results.<bold>Results: </bold>Most employees (86%) chose to participate, but there were important socioeconomic differences: some key target populations, including smokers and obese employees, were the least likely to sign up; less educated employees were also less likely to complete program activities. Despite mostly negative opinions of the program, almost half of participants reported making lifestyle changes.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Oregon's HEM launch was largely unpopular with employees, but many reported making the desired lifestyle changes. However, some of those the program is most interested in enrolling were the least likely to engage. People involved with implementing similar programs will need to think carefully about how to cultivate broad interest among employees. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To describe the prevalence and determinants of sodium-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among U.S. adults Design. A cross-sectional survey was used.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study was set in the United States in 2012.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Participants were 6122 U.S. adults.<bold>Measures: </bold>Sodium-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were measured.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Chi-squared tests were used to determine differences in sodium-related knowledge, attitude, and behaviors by respondent characteristics; multiple logistic regression was used to examine associations between selected respondent characteristics and health professional advice, reported action, or knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (adjusted for all other respondent characteristics).<bold>Results: </bold>About three-fourths of respondents answered eating too much sodium is "somewhat" or "very" harmful to their health. Twenty-six percent reported receiving health professional advice, and 45% reported taking action to reduce their sodium intake. The prevalence of reported action was highest among adults receiving advice, those with hypertension, blacks, and those aged ≥65 years. Sixty-two percent who reported action agreed that most of their sodium comes from processed or restaurant foods. Of those reporting action, the most common tactics to reduce sodium intake were checking nutrition labels, using other spices than salt, and choosing low-sodium foods; requesting lower-sodium options when eating out was the least common tactic.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Results suggest almost half of adults overall and the vast majority of those receiving health professional advice are taking some action to watch or reduce sodium intake. Although a substantial proportion report using recommended tactics to lower intake, many are not using the most effective tactics. In order to reach the general population, health communication messages could be simpler and focus on the most effective tactics to reduce sodium intake. Furthermore, health professionals can help reduce sodium intake by discussing the benefits of sodium reduction and tactics to do so, regardless of a hypertension diagnosis. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Providers asked about illicit drug use in 81% of the visits. One hundred twenty-three patients (29%) disclosed any current or past illicit drug use; 48 patients (11%) disclosed current use of marijuana while pregnant. One hundred and forty-five samples (34%) tested positive for one or more substances; marijuana was most commonly detected (N = 114, 27%). Of patients who tested positive for any substance, 66 (46%) did not disclose any use; only 36% of patients who tested positive for marijuana disclosed current use.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Although marijuana is illegal in Pennsylvania, a high proportion of pregnant patients used marijuana, with many not disclosing use to their obstetric care providers.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To develop a theory-based questionnaire to assess readiness for change in small workplaces adopting wellness programs.<bold>Design: </bold>In developing our scale, we first tested items via "think-aloud" interviews. We tested the revised items in a cross-sectional quantitative telephone survey.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study setting comprised small workplaces (20-250 employees) in low-wage industries.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Decision-makers representing small workplaces in King County, Washington (think-aloud interviews, n = 9), and the United States (telephone survey, n = 201) served as study subjects.<bold>Measures: </bold>We generated items for each construct in Weiner's theory of organizational readiness for change. We also measured workplace characteristics and current implementation of workplace wellness programs.<bold>Analysis: </bold>We assessed reliability by coefficient alpha for each of the readiness questionnaire subscales. We tested the association of all subscales with employers' current implementation of wellness policies, programs, and communications, and conducted a path analysis to test the associations in the theory of organizational readiness to change.<bold>Results: </bold>Each of the readiness subscales exhibited acceptable internal reliability (coefficient alpha range, .75-.88) and was positively associated with wellness program implementation ( p < .05). The path analysis was consistent with the theory of organizational readiness to change, except change efficacy did not predict change-related effort.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>We developed a new questionnaire to assess small workplaces' readiness to adopt and implement evidence-based wellness programs. Our findings also provide empirical validation of Weiner's theory of readiness for change. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Exclusion criteria were (1) non-peer-reviewed articles or conference abstracts and (2) interventions focused on treatment of chronic conditions or lifestyle factors other than PA or diet in nurses.<bold>Data Extraction: </bold>Seventy-one full texts were retrieved and assessed for inclusion by two reviewers. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer.<bold>Data Synthesis: </bold>Extracted data were synthesized in a tabular format and narrative summary.<bold>Results: </bold>Nine (n = 737 nurses) studies met the inclusion criteria. Quality of the studies was low to moderate. Four studies reported an increase in self-reported PA through structured exercise and goal setting. Dietary outcomes were generally positive, but were only measured in three studies with some limitations in the assessment methods. Two studies reported improved body composition without significant changes in diet or PA.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Outcomes of interventions to change nurses' PA and diet behavior are promising, but inconsistent. Additional and higher quality interventions that include objective and validated outcome measures and appropriate process evaluation are required. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Article frequencies and attributes were compared between groups and over time using negative binomial regression for longitudinal data, with county-level demographics as covariates.<bold>Results: </bold>In the last 3 years, there were approximately twice as many articles in intervention than in comparison counties. Media clips from newspapers in intervention counties were between 1.4 and 2 times more likely to have front page placement and percent of relevant topic or theme than were those in comparison counties. There was no difference in rate of pro-health articles by group.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The policy advocacy intervention to promote smoke-free policy increased media attention to SHS and may have increased public awareness of issues related to smoke-free policy.

AB- Purpose. This study aimed to examine the effect of a multicomponent intervention program on consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and lifestyle factors associated with SSB intake, in Hispanic children from low-income families. Design. A five-wave longitudinal study using a quasi-experimental design was conducted. Setting. Five elementary schools in West Texas served as the setting. Subjects. Participants included 555 predominantly Hispanic children (ages 5-9 years) from low-income families and their parents (n = 525). Intervention. A multicomponent intervention program was implemented. Measures. Children's anthropometric measures were obtained. Their weight status was determined based on body mass index for age and gender. Parents responded to a demographic questionnaire, a shelf inventory, an acculturation scale, and a family survey. Analysis. Growth curve analyses were used to test differences between intervention and comparison participants' SSB intake and to examine potential covariates. Results. Comparison group children's daily SSB intake significantly increased over time (B =1.06 ± .40 ounces per month, p< .01), but this linear increase of SSB was slowed down by the intervention (B=−.29 ± .12, p< .05). More daily TV time, more fast food intake, and more types of SSBs available at home were associated with higher SSB intake. Conclusion. Risk factors of childhood obesity were associated with each other. The intervention program produced a modest reduction in SSB consumed by economically disadvantaged and predominantly Hispanic children. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To identify and describe homogenous classes of male college students based on their weight-related behaviors (e.g., eating habits, physical activity, and unhealthy weight control) and to examine differences by sexual orientation.<bold>Design: </bold>Study design was a cross-sectional sample of 2- and 4-year college students.<bold>Setting: </bold>Study setting was forty-six 2- and 4-year colleges in Minnesota.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Study subjects comprised 10,406 college males.<bold>Measures: </bold>Measures were five categories of sexual orientation derived from self-reported sexual identity and behavior (heterosexual, discordant heterosexual [identifies as heterosexual and engages in same-sex sexual behavior], gay, bisexual, and unsure) and nine weight-related behaviors (including measures for eating habits, physical activity, and unhealthy weight control).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Latent class models were fit for each of the five sexual orientation groups, using the nine weight-related behaviors.<bold>Results: </bold>Overall, four classes were identified: "healthier eating habits" (prevalence range, 39.4%-77.3%), "moderate eating habits" (12.0%-30.2%), "unhealthy weight control" (2.6%-30.4%), and "healthier eating habits, more physically active" (35.8%). Heterosexual males exhibited all four patterns, gay and unsure males exhibited four patterns that included variations on the overall classes identified, discordant heterosexual males exhibited two patterns ("healthier eating habits" and "unhealthy weight control"), and bisexual males exhibited three patterns ("healthier eating habits," "moderate eating habits," and "unhealthy weight control").<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Findings highlight the need for multibehavioral interventions for discordant heterosexual, gay, bisexual, and unsure college males, particularly around encouraging physical activity and reducing unhealthy weight control behaviors.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>This study examined the effects of tai chi (TC) on biobehavioral factors associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in women.<bold>Design: </bold>A randomized trial used a wait-list control group, pretest-posttest design. Data were collected immediately before, immediately after, and 2 months following the intervention.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study was community based in central Virginia.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Women aged 35 to 50 years at increased risk for CVD.<bold>Intervention: </bold>The 8-week intervention built on prior work and was designed to impact biobehavioral factors associated with CVD risk in women.<bold>Measures: </bold>Biological measures included fasting glucose, insulin, and lipids as well as C-reactive protein and cytokines. Behavioral measures included fatigue, perceived stress, depressive symptoms, social support, mindfulness, self-compassion, and spiritual thoughts and behaviors.<bold>Analysis: </bold>A mixed effects linear model was used to test for differences between groups across time.<bold>Results: </bold>In 63 women, TC was shown to decrease fatigue (∂ [difference in group means] = 9.38, p = .001) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (∂ = 12.61, p = .052). Consistent with the study model and intervention design, significant changes observed 2 months post intervention indicated that TC may help down-regulate proinflammatory cytokines associated with underlying CVD risk, including interferon gamma (∂ = 149.90, p = .002), tumor necrosis factor (∂ = 16.78, p = .002), interleukin (IL) 8 (∂ = 6.47, p = .026), and IL-4 (∂ = 2.13, p = .001), and may increase mindfulness (∂ = .54, p = .021), spiritual thoughts and behaviors (∂ = 8.30, p = .009), and self-compassion (∂ = .44, p = .045).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This study contributes important insights into the potential benefits and mechanisms of TC and, with further research, may ultimately lead to effective strategies for reducing CVD risk in women earlier in the CVD trajectory.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To test an iPad-delivered multiple behavior tailored intervention (Healthy Pregnancy: Step by Step) for pregnant women that addresses smoking cessation, stress management, and fruit and vegetable consumption.<bold>Design: </bold>A randomized 2 × 5 factorial repeated measures design was employed with randomization on the individual level stratified on behavior risk. Women completed three sessions during pregnancy and two postpartum at postdelivery months 1 and 4.<bold>Setting: </bold>Women were recruited from six locations of federally funded health centers across three states.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Participants (N = 335) were English- and Spanish-speaking women at up to 18 weeks gestation.<bold>Intervention: </bold>The treatment group received three interactive sessions focused on two priority health behavior risks. The sessions offered individually tailored and stage-matched change strategies based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change. The usual care group received March of Dimes brochures.<bold>Measures: </bold>The primary outcome was the number of behavior risks. Stage of change and continuous measures for all behaviors also were assessed.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Data were analyzed across all time points using generalized estimating equations examining repeated measures effects.<bold>Results: </bold>Women in the treatment group reported significantly fewer risks than those in usual care at 1 month (.85 vs. 1.20, odds ratio [OR] = .70) and 4 months postpartum (.72 vs. .91, OR = .81).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Healthy Pregnancy is an evidence-based and personalized program that assists pregnant women with reducing behavior risks and sustaining healthy lifestyle behaviors.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To distinguish the origins of higher weight status and determine when and why intra- and interracial/ethnic disparities emerge.<bold>Design: </bold>The study used a longitudinal analysis of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B).<bold>Setting: </bold>The study was conducted in the United States.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Participants were children of non-Hispanic white mothers and children of U.S.- and foreign-born mothers of Mexican origin from a nationally representative sample of children born in the year 2001 (N ≈ 3700).<bold>Measures: </bold>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts determined sex- and age-specific weight status. Covariates were obtained from birth certificate records and parent interviews.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Frequencies, growth curve trajectories, and ordinary least squares regression examined body mass index (BMI) and obesity across survey waves.<bold>Results: </bold>Compared to their peers with non-Hispanic white mothers, children of Mexican-heritage mothers have higher average BMI and greater rates of obesity. The BMI of boys with Mexican-born mothers is higher relative to whites and children of U.S.-born Mexican mothers across early childhood, increasing sharply at about age 4.5 years. This divergence is driven by increases in the BMI of boys, as girls do not show the same growth. A number of measures, including descriptors of children's nutritional intake, lifestyle factors, and acculturation, do not explain the increased obesity rates among sons of Mexican mothers.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Despite favorable perinatal health and weight, Mexican-American sons of foreign-born mothers show disadvantages in BMI that emerge close to the start of kindergarten.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To explore barriers, facilitators, and motivators to adopting and maintaining regular physical activity among women with obesity who have undergone bariatric surgery.<bold>Approach: </bold>Individual interviews with women 3 to 24 months post-bariatric surgery.<bold>Setting: </bold>Participants were recruited from a bariatric clinic in Montreal, Canada.<bold>Participants: </bold>Twelve women were recruited (mean age = 47 ± 9 years) using poster advertisements and word of mouth. Participants were on average 15 months postsurgery.<bold>Method: </bold>Each woman was interviewed once using a semistructured interview protocol. Recruitment was conducted until data saturation (i.e., no new information emerged). The interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.<bold>Results: </bold>Three interrelated themes emerged: the physical body, appraisal of the physical and social self, and the exercise environment. Barriers included weight-restricted mobility, side effects of surgery, body dissatisfaction, compromised psychological health, competing responsibilities, a lack of exercise self-efficacy and social support, reduced access to accommodating facilities, lack of exercise knowledge, and northern climate. Participants reported postsurgical weight loss, weight and health maintenance, enjoyment, body image, and supportive active relationships, as well as access to accommodating facilities and exercise knowledge, as facilitators and motivators.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Suggested physical activity programming strategies for health care professionals working with this unique population are discussed. Physical activity and health promotion initiatives can also benefit from a cultural paradigm shift away from weight-based representations of health. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

After adjustments, participants exhibiting greater restlessness and cravings over time, respectively, had 3.59 (p = .01) and 4.31 (p = .008) greater odds of being a smoking nonsmoker at baseline but then transitioning into a smoking smoker at 2-year follow-up.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>These findings may have implications with respect to interventions emphasizing withdrawal and craving symptoms. Further, given that some youth smokers self-identify as nonsmokers, and do so over time, potential intervention efforts may be pointed toward cognitive-related strategies at improving self-perceptions.

Cost of snacks increased by $0.02/snack in the intervention ASPs ($0.36 to $0.38) compared to a $0.01 per snack decrease in the control group ($0.39 to $0.38). Across both assessments and groups, 80% to 100% of children consumed FVs.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The STEPs-HE intervention can assist ASPs in meeting nationally endorsed nutrition policies with marginal increases in cost.

Interviews were transcribed verbatim and deductively (i.e., using RE-AIM as themes) coded for meaning units, placed into higher-order categories, and summarized in narrative. Supporting quantitative data (e.g., the proportion of eligible students that joined the program, rate of school-level adoption) were calculated using descriptive statistics.<bold>Results: </bold>Backpack programs with a broad reach and evidenced effect may be appealing to adopt. Weekend food bags cost an average $3.87 (SD ± .94) and there were some positive (i.e., ease, protecting participants' privacy) and very few negative (logistical) components of implementation. Collaborators and community partners are necessary for long-term sustainability.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Backpack programs are widespread and have potential to relieve weekend hunger; however, more efforts need to be made to end childhood hunger.

In Navajo convenience stores, 100% whole grain products, reduced-fat cheese, lean meats, reduced-fat chips, and fat-free or light hot dogs were available in fewer stores than their corresponding less-healthy versions (all with p < .05). In both Navajo supermarkets and convenience stores, 100% whole wheat bread, lean cold cuts, and reduced-fat cheese were all more expensive per unit than their corresponding less-healthy versions (all with p < .05).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>According to this study, healthier foods are not as readily available in Navajo convenience stores as they are in Navajo supermarkets. Improving access to and affordability of healthier foods in reservation stores of all sizes may support healthy eating among Navajo residents. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Topics include the failure of most Americans to adopt a healthy lifestyle, the need to encourage employees to make healthy lifestyle a habit, and the effectiveness of habit-based interventions for wellness. It argues that organizations wanting a sustainable behavior change must go beyond health promotion and training to achieve their goals.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Research demonstrates that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality. Few studies have examined the effects of light-intensity physical activity on mortality. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the association between objectively measured light-intensity physical activity and all-cause mortality risk.<bold>Design: </bold>Longitudinal.<bold>Setting: </bold>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 with follow-up through December 31, 2011.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Five thousand five hundred seventy-five U.S. adults.<bold>Measures: </bold>Participants wore an accelerometer for at least 4 days and completed questionnaires to assess sociodemographics and chronic disease information, with blood samples taken to assess biological markers. Follow-up mortality status was assessed via death certificate data from the National Death Index.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Cox proportional hazard model.<bold>Results: </bold>After adjusting for accelerometer-determined MVPA, age, gender, race-ethnicity, cotinine, weight status, poverty level, C-reactive protein, and comorbid illness, for every 60-minute increase in accelerometer-determined light-intensity physical activity, participants had a 16% reduced hazard of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = .84; 95% confidence interval: .78-.91; p < .001).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In this national sample of U.S. adults, light-intensity physical activity was inversely associated with all-cause mortality risk, independent of age, MVPA, and other potential confounders. In addition to MVPA, promotion of light-intensity physical activity is warranted. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Children's food intake pattern did not reflect this understanding, suggesting a need for culturally tailoring an intervention to impact the poor food intake and physical inactivity in two low-income African-American Delta communities.

AB- The proposed "Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act" states that the collection of information about the manifested disease or disorder of a family member shall not be considered an unlawful acquisition of genetic information. The bill recognizes employee privacy protections that are already in place and includes specific language relating to nondiscrimination based on illness. Why did legislation expressly intending to "preserve wellness programs" generate such antipathy about wellness among journalists? This article argues that those who are committed to preserving employee wellness must be equally committed to preserving employee privacy. Related to this, we should better parse between discussions and rules about commonplace health screenings versus much less common genetic testing. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Online questionnaires were filled out in 2013 (T0) and 2014 (T1).<bold>Setting: </bold>A random sample of a Dutch online interview panel was obtained.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Data of 4231 Dutch adults who had complete data at T0 and T1 were used in the present study. Participants were representative for the Dutch adult population in terms of age, gender, and having chronic disease(s).<bold>Measures: </bold>Healthy Lifestyle Index (HLI), vitality, and health-care and productivity-related costs. The HLI consisted of the sum of 6 healthy lifestyle characteristics, including a healthy BMI (yes/no), meeting physical activity, fruit, vegetable, and alcohol consumption guidelines (yes/no), and smoking status (yes: non or former smoker/no: current smoker). Health-care and productivity-related costs were measured using a utilization questionnaire.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Linear regression analysis.<bold>Results: </bold>The HLI was related to vitality. In addition, vitality was related to health-care costs and productivity-related costs. Furthermore, vitality was found to transmit 28.4% of the effect of HLI on health-care costs and 39.4% of the effect of HLI on productivity-related costs.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Lifestyle was related to vitality and vitality to health-care and productivity-related costs. Vitality mediated the relationship between lifestyle and health-care and productivity-related costs. Therefore, we recommend to sustain and improve both vitality and lifestyle. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose . This project examined potential changes in health behaviors following wellness coaching. Design . In a single cohort study design, wellness coaching participants were recruited in 2011, data were collected through July 2012, and were analyzed through December 2013. Items in the study questionnaire used requested information about 11 health behaviors, self-efficacy for eating, and goal-setting skills. Setting . Worksite wellness center. Participants . One-hundred employee wellness center members with an average age of 42 years; 90% were female and most were overweight or obese. Intervention . Twelve weeks of in-person, one-on-one wellness coaching. Method . Participants completed study questionnaires when they started wellness coaching (baseline), after 12 weeks of wellness coaching, and at a 3-month follow-up. Results . From baseline to week 12, these 100 wellness coaching participants improved their self-reported health behaviors (11 domains, 0- to 10-point scale) from an average of 6.4 to 7.7 (p < .001), eating self-efficacy from an average of 112 to 142 (on a 0- to 180-point scale; p < .001), and goal-setting skills from an average of 49 to 55 (on a 16- to 80-point scale; p < .001). Conclusion . These results suggest that participants improved their current health behaviors and learned skills for continued healthy living. Future studies that use randomized controlled trials are needed to establish causality for wellness coaching. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Weight loss was compared using t tests.<bold>Results: </bold>Among participants eligible to make deposits, 29% made ≥1 deposit and matching did not increase participation. At 24 weeks, control participants gained an average of 1.0 pound, whereas 1:1 match participants lost an average of 5.3 pounds (P = .005). After 36 weeks, control participants gained an average of 2.1 pounds, whereas no match participants lost an average of 5.1 pounds (P = .008).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Participation in deposit contracts to promote weight loss was low, and matching deposits did not increase participation. For deposit contracts to impact population health, ongoing participation will need to be higher. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose . We assessed factors associated with tobacco vendor compliance with India's Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) provisions regulating tobacco sales and point-of-sale (POS) environments. Design . Study design was a cross-sectional random sample of tobacco vendors in Mumbai, India (2010). Setting . School-adjacent neighborhoods were the study setting. Subjects . Study subjects were tobacco vendors (n = 436). Measures . Face-to-face interviews, and audits of POS environments were used to assess compliance. Analysis . Factors associated with compliance were identified using logistic regression. Results . About 4% of vendors were fully compliant. Although 80% reported compliance with the ban on tobacco sales to minors, only 10% displayed signage about the ban. About 84% were compliant with the two-tobacco advertisement limit; of those displaying advertisements, 67% were compliant with size limits, 68% with content restrictions, and 8% with health warning requirements. Knowledge about fines for noncompliance was associated with compliance with the ban on sales to minors (odds ratio [OR], 2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26, 3.56) and signage requirement (OR, 4.42; 95% CI, 1.76, 11.13). Greater compliance with the two-advertisement limit was associated with higher store income from tobacco (OR, .26; 95% CI, .09, .73) and lower neighborhood socioeconomic status (p < .01); the latter was associated with advertisement size limits compliance (p < .05). Conclusions . Compliance with COTPA provisions was low. Interventions modifying vendor knowledge about provisions and fines may increase compliance, and they should target stores that are reliant on tobacco sales. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

The intervention phase included marketing and price incentives/disincentives for healthy and unhealthy items, with a 35% price differential.<bold>Measures: </bold>Average and proportional change in sales and impact on financial outcomes were assessed.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Two-way factorial analyses of variance and two-proportion Z-score tests were run to assess change in sales. Independent samples t tests were used to test for changes in profit.<bold>Results: </bold>Significant impact was demonstrated on all burger sales in the desired direction during intervention (P < .001). Most notably, the average weekly turkey burger sales at Penrose Hospital (PH) increased 13-fold (10.85-145.59) and became the majority of the market share (51.8%, P < .001). For salads, significant interaction between phase and food type was found at St. Francis Medical Center (SFMC) (P = .002) but not at PH (P = .304). Healthy PH salads were popular at baseline and intervention, comprising the majority of the market share throughout the entire study (68.4%-70.2%, respectively, P = .238). Cafeteria gross sales and burger profit (P < .001) increased at both cafeterias.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Incentivizing consumers through price interventions changed hospital cafeteria food sales in the desired direction while improving the bottom line.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>The explosive rise in Internet use calls for effective ways to utilize new forms of social media to enhance school smoking prevention programs. We attempted to design and test an educational intervention for youth tobacco prevention.<bold>Design: </bold>Intervention design and posttest pilot implementation.<bold>Setting: </bold>A single high school in Athens, Greece.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Two hundred twenty-five students (aged 15-18 years).<bold>Intervention: </bold>A Facebook-integrated educational intervention in six simple steps was designed and tested during an ad hoc smoking prevention lecture to high school students in Greece in order to stimulate social mobilization in online networks.<bold>Measures: </bold>Number of students with an active Facebook account, percentage posting antismoking messages within a 72-hour period, number of Facebook friends reached.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive statistics.<bold>Results: </bold>Assessed 3 days after the lecture, 15.9% of students had posted a smoking-related sentence in their Facebook account, a take-home message that was spread as a note on their wall via news feed to their 20,095 cumulative Facebook friends.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>One smoking-related take-home message can spread virally to a large number of adolescents through their Facebook friends. This intervention provides insight into a novel way of providing health information to youth, a hard-to-reach and vulnerable population. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Previous surveys of housing operators have identified concerns about enforcement, legal issues, and loss of market share as the main barriers to implementing smoke-free policies in multiunit housing. The purpose of this study was to examine enforcement practices as well as economic and legal outcomes in smoke-free affordable multiunit housing.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional.<bold>Setting: </bold>Affordable multiunit housing in North Carolina.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Affordable multiunit housing properties (n = 1063, 57% response rate).<bold>Measures: </bold>Property representatives completed a written survey with questions regarding the existence of smoke-free policies, smoke-free policy implementation and enforcement practices, and smoking-related costs.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive statistics, χ(2) goodness-of-fit test, and t-test.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 16.5% of properties had policies that prohibited smoking in all residential units. Half (49.8%) of smoke-free properties reported no violations to their policies in the past 12 months. Legal actions to enforce policies were rarely needed and were successful when they did occur. Compared to smoking-allowed properties, smoke-free properties did not experience a loss of market share in terms of occupancy rate (t = .09; p = .93) or residents moving away (χ(2) =. 5; p = .48).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Housing operators' concerns about enforcement, legal issues, and loss of market share associated with smoke-free policies are largely unfounded among affordable housing properties in North Carolina. Public health professionals should use messaging strategies that refute these concerns to encourage more properties to adopt smoke-free policies. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

This study evaluates the effect of Tips on state-specific quitline calls.<bold>Design: </bold>Precampaign, during-campaign, and postcampaign comparison; regression modeling.<bold>Setting: </bold>All fifty states as well as the District of Columbia.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Calls to state quitlines.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Tips.<bold>Measures: </bold>Tips campaign exposure was measured by gross rating points (GRPs). Calls to quitline's 1-800-QUIT-NOW were assigned to markets in each state based on their area codes.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariate regression was used to assess the relationship between calls to state quitlines and media market-level Tips GRPs, while controlling for market and area code characteristics.<bold>Results: </bold>Nationally, every 100 Tips GRPs per week at the market level was associated with an average of 45 additional quitline calls in each area code (β = 44.65, p < .001). Tips GRPs were associated with significant increases in quitline calls in 46 states and the District of Columbia, of which 11 experienced effects significantly larger than the national average and 5 experienced significantly smaller effects. We were unable to detect statistically significant effects of GRPs on call volumes for four states. Graphically, call volumes in those states followed Tips GRPs.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The Tips campaign significantly increased calls to quitlines for almost all the states. These findings underscore the effectiveness of national tobacco media campaigns for reaching state audiences. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Previous studies found that treatment effects can change two behaviors, but not one. This study examined baseline transtheoretical model constructs as three alternative predictors (stage of change, effort, and severity) of singular action among participants with co-occurring health behavior risks.<bold>Design: </bold>The study examined participants at risk for three pairs of behaviors (sun and smoking; smoking and diet; and diet and sun). Analyses were conducted with participants who changed only one behavior in a pair (singular action).<bold>Setting: </bold>School and home-based behavior change programs recruited participants via schools, worksites, and physician practices. School, worksite, medical, and home-based prevention programs were the study setting.<bold>Subjects: </bold>The sample (N = 3213) was age 44.6 years (SD, 11.1 years), 94.6% white, and 63.7% female.<bold>Measures: </bold>Stages of change, effort, and severity variables were measured.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Pooled data were analyzed using logistic regressions from three randomized controlled trials.<bold>Results: </bold>Across all three behaviors, stage of change, effort, and severity effects were consistently related to behavior change at 24 months. Change efforts on one behavior were related to change on another behavior. Baseline sun severity (odds ratio, .97 [.94, 1.00]; p = .046) and smoking severity (odds ratio, .89 [.80, .98]; p = .019) were significant predictors of change on diet at final follow-up.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Stage of change was the biggest predictor. Problem severity was the smallest predictor of change at 2-year follow-up. Four of six predictors were within behaviors, whereas two were between. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Exposure variables were Hispanic ethnicity and proxies of acculturation (language of interview, birthplace, and years living in the United States).<bold>Analysis: </bold>We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the exposure variables associated with drinking SSB ≥1 time/d after controlling for covariates.<bold>Results: </bold>The adjusted odds of drinking SSB ≥1 time/d was significantly higher among Hispanics who completed the interview in Spanish (OR = 1.65) than U.S.-born non-Hispanic whites. Compared with those who lived in the United States for <5 years, the adjusted odds of drinking SSB ≥1 time/d was higher among adults who lived in the United States for 5 to <10 years (OR = 2.72), those who lived in the United States for 10 to <15 years (OR = 2.90), and those who lived in the United States for ≥15 years (OR = 2.41). However, birthplace was not associated with daily SSB intake.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The acculturation process is complex and these findings contribute to identifying important subpopulations that may benefit from targeted intervention to reduce SSB intake.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To determine whether an experiential nutrition education intervention focusing on spices and herbs ("Spice MyPlate") is feasible and improves diet quality and healthy eating attitudes among an urban and predominantly African-American sample of adolescents more than standard nutrition education alone.<bold>Design: </bold>A nonrandomized controlled trial compared standard nutrition education in U.S. Department of Agriculture MyPlate guidelines (control group) with standard nutrition education plus adjuvant Spice MyPlate curriculum (intervention group). Data were collected at baseline and after 3, 6, and 10 weeks.<bold>Setting: </bold>Study setting was two public high schools in Baltimore, Maryland.<bold>Subjects: </bold>A total of 110 students in grades 9 to 12 participated.<bold>Intervention: </bold>The 6-week school-based intervention conducted during health class focused on cooking using spices and herbs to eat healthier diets according to MyPlate.<bold>Measures: </bold>Dietary intake reported on 3-day food records and healthy eating attitudes questionnaires was analyzed.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Differences in diet quality and healthy eating attitudes between study groups were estimated by t-tests, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests, and covariate-adjusted regression models.<bold>Results: </bold>Spice MyPlate was feasible and there were modest but significant improvements (p ≤ .05) in the Spice MyPlate group compared with control in whole grains (31.2 g/wk) and protein foods (13.2 ounces per week) intake, and attitudes toward eating vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Although randomized trials are needed, experiential nutrition education focusing on spices and herbs may help urban and predominantly African-American adolescent populations eat healthier diets.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To compare the effects of a physical activity (PA) intervention of group meetings versus group meetings supplemented by personal calls or automated calls on the adoption and maintenance of PA and on weight stability among African-American women.<bold>Design: </bold>Randomized clinical trial with three conditions randomly assigned across six sites.<bold>Setting: </bold>Health settings in predominately African-American communities.<bold>Subjects: </bold>There were 288 women, aged 40 to 65, without major signs/symptoms of pulmonary/cardiovascular disease.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Six group meetings delivered over 48 weeks with either 11 personal motivational calls, 11 automated motivational messages, or no calls between meetings.<bold>Measures: </bold>Measures included PA (questionnaires, accelerometer, aerobic fitness), weight, and body composition at baseline, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Analysis of variance and mixed models.<bold>Results: </bold>Retention was 90% at 48 weeks. Adherence to PA increased significantly (p < .001) for questionnaire (d = .56, 128 min/wk), accelerometer (d = .37, 830 steps/d), and aerobic fitness (d = .41, 7 steps/2 min) at 24 weeks and was maintained at 48 weeks (p < .001), with no differences across conditions. Weight and body composition showed no significant changes over the course of the study.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Group meetings are a powerful intervention for increasing PA and preventing weight gain and may not need to be supplemented with telephone calls, which add costs and complexity.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Studies have examined the independent and additive effects of health behaviors (e.g., physical activity, diet, sleep, and smoking) on systemic inflammation, but we know little about whether different pairs of these behaviors differentially influence inflammation, which was the purpose of this study.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional.<bold>Setting: </bold>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006.<bold>Subjects: </bold>A total of 2051 adults (≥20 years).<bold>Measures: </bold>A questionnaire/interview was used to assess sleep and dietary behavior; physical activity was assessed via accelerometry; smoking was assessed via cotinine levels; and a blood sample was taken to assess systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein; [CRP]).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multivariable linear regression analysis.<bold>Results: </bold>Six health behavior pairs were evaluated: (1) active and healthy diet, (2) active and adequate sleep, (3) active and nonsmoker, (4) healthy diet and adequate sleep, (5) healthy diet and nonsmoker, and (6) adequate sleep and nonsmoker. After adjusting for age, gender, race-ethnicity, poverty level, and chronic disease, only active and nonsmoker (β = -.15) and healthy diet and adequate sleep (β = -.16) were associated with CRP.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Regular physical activity and smoking avoidance and healthy eating and adequate sleep were the two health behavior pairs associated with less inflammation. This suggests that certain health behaviors may act synergistically on reducing systemic inflammation, whereas other health behavior combinations may not. Such knowledge may help to develop and implement tailored health behavior interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>The purpose of this study is to: (1) identify characteristics associated with dog owners who walk their dog, (2) describe the frequency and duration of walking the dog, and (3) determine whether dog owners who walk their dog participate in more physical activity than dog owners who do not walk their dog and non-dog owners.<bold>Design: </bold>A cross-sectional study design was used.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study setting was nationwide.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Adults (n = 4010) participating in the 2005 ConsumerStyles mail-panel survey were the study subjects.<bold>Measures: </bold>Measures used were demographic, physical activity, dog ownership, and dog walking questions from the 2005 ConsumerStyles mail-panel survey.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Chi-square tests and analyses of variance were conducted to examine participant characteristics associated with dog walking and to describe the frequency and duration of dog walking. Analysis of covariance was used to determine whether dog owners who walk their dog participate in more physical activity than dog owners who do not walk their dog and non-dog owners.<bold>Results: </bold>Among dog owners, 42% reported some dog walking in a typical week. Dog owners walked their dog an average 4.3 ± 0.1 times and 128.8 ± 5.6 minutes per week. There were no significant differences in weekly minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity across the dog-ownership and dog walking groups.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Most dog owners did not walk their dog. Dog owners were not more active than non-dog owners, except when considering the activity obtained via dog walking. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Sedentary activities were playing bingo, computer use, doing crosswords/puzzles, handicrafts, listening to radio/music, playing a musical instrument, reading, visiting others, and watching TV.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Chi-squares, t-tests and multivariable logistic regressions.<bold>Results: </bold>Among respondents not diagnosed with a mood disorder, positive associations were noted for crosswords/puzzles in older adults (odds ratio [OR]: 1.39, confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.91) and listening to radio/music or playing an instrument in middle-aged adults (OR: 1.43, CI: 1.16-1.75; OR: 2.14, CI: 1.17-3.81). Satisfaction with life was positively associated with computer use in middle-aged (OR: 1.53, CI: 1.07-2.20) and older adults (OR: 1.42, CI: 1.09-1.84). Sense of belonging was consistently positively associated with sedentary activities.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Several sedentary activities were found to be positively associated with self-reported measures of psychosocial wellness in middle-aged and older adults. These findings identify potential opportunities for sedentary time interventions and dual-task physical activity promotion. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To test the effectiveness of an intervention delivered by health professionals outside the school environment to girls identified with issues such as poor body image, low self-esteem, low self-confidence, nonparticipation in sports, or being overweight or underweight.<bold>Design: </bold>The study's design was a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of an intervention on self-esteem, impairment induced by eating disorders, self-efficacy, body satisfaction, and dieting behaviors.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study took place at the community health center located in a culturally diverse area of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Participants were 122 primary and secondary school girls between 10 and 16 years of age.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Girls on the Go! is a 10-week program designed to improve self-esteem, body image, and confidence, using an empowerment model that involved interactive and experiential learning approaches. Weekly themes included body image and self-esteem, safety and assertiveness, a healthy mind, physical activity, healthy eating, trust and confidence, and connections.<bold>Measures: </bold>Measurements were made using Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, clinical interview assessment, health self-efficacy (included mental health and physical health self-efficacy scales), body esteem scale, and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire for Children.<bold>Analysis: </bold>A linear mixed model was used.<bold>Results: </bold>The intervention led to a significant increase (p < .05) in self-esteem and self-efficacy (mental and physical health self-efficacy subscales), for both primary and secondary school-aged participants and reduced dieting behaviors (secondary school participants). These gains were retained after 6 months of follow-up.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This group-based, low-dose intervention, which, although targeting girls with a range of psychological issues and including both overweight and underweight participants, is a successful means of improving self-esteem among girls from diverse cultural backgrounds.

City-level factors obtained from Census data included percentage of commuters by walking, bicycling, and public transit. The dependent variable was self-reported participation in developing, adopting, or implementing a local land use policy supportive of active living.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Hierarchical (two-level: municipal official-city) logistic regression model, using R.<bold>Results: </bold>Municipal officials living in the city where they worked were significantly more likely to be involved in a land use policy. Higher perceived importance of livability issues was associated with participation. Perceived importance of physical activity was inversely associated with land use policy involvement. Higher city-level bicycling rates resulted in increased odds of participation in a land use policy. City-level walking rates were inversely associated with land use policy participation.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Municipal officials who worked in cities with a higher proportion of bicycle commuters, who prioritized livability issues, and who resided in the city where they worked were more likely to engage in land use policies supportive of active living.

Of 4296 articles retrieved, 14 RCTs (3044 pregnant women) met the inclusion criteria.<bold>Data Synthesis: </bold>Pooled effect sizes (ESs) were calculated using a fixed model.<bold>Results: </bold>Overall, physical exercise programs during pregnancy produced a small reduction in neonatal birth weight (ES = -.10; p = .04). The Apgar score at 1 minute was also weakly increased with combined exercise (aerobic, strength, and flexibility) (ES = .09; p = .048) and no differences between groups were observed in gestational age at delivery and Apgar score at 5 minutes.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Structured physical exercise programs during pregnancy appear to be safe for the neonate, mainly favoring a lower birth weight within normal range. However, more studies are needed to establish recommendations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status disparities were identified in use (non-Hispanic [NH] blacks vs. NH whites OR = .43 [.25, .74]) and helpfulness (NH blacks vs. NH whites β = -.06 [-.44, .32]).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Findings highlight potential subgroups to target for communication and education efforts regarding use of calorie information in restaurants. Following publication of final rules for federal menu-labeling legislation and implementation, further surveillance of public response to this information may inform message framing and educational interventions to promote use of calorie information on menu boards.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To investigate how breastfeeding initiation and duration affect the likelihood of being overweight and obese in children aged 2 to 5.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional data from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health.<bold>Setting: </bold>Rural and urban areas of the United States.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Households where at least one member was between the ages of 2 and 5 (sample size 8207).<bold>Measures: </bold>Parent-reported body mass index, breastfeeding initiation and duration, covariates (gender, family income and education, ethnicity, child care attendance, maternal health and physical activity, residential area).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Partial proportional odds models.<bold>Results: </bold>In early childhood, breastfed children had 5.3% higher probability of being normal weight (p = .002) and 8.9% (p < .001) lower probability of being obese compared to children who had never been breastfed. Children who had been breastfed for less than 3 months had 3.1% lower probability of being normal weight (p = .013) and 4.7% higher probability of being obese (p = .013) with respect to children who had been breastfed for 3 months and above.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Study findings suggest that length of breastfeeding, whether exclusive or not, may be associated with lower risk of obesity in early childhood. However, caution is needed in generalizing results because of the limitations of the analysis. Based on findings from this study and others, breastfeeding promotion policies can cite the potential protective effect that breastfeeding has on weight in early childhood. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Smoking abstinence was assessed by participant self-report. Both a simple imputation method (i.e., missing = smoking) and completers-only analyses were conducted. Stepwise logistic regression was used to determine baseline predictors of abstinence.<bold>Results: </bold>Thirty-day abstinence rate was 52.5% during the contest month and 20.5% at the 6-month follow-up. Baseline intention to stay quit (odds ratio [OR] = 1.56, p = .01), cigarettes smoked per day (OR = .67, p = .04), and 2-year (vs. 4-year) college (OR = 1.65, p = .05) predicted abstinence at 6 months.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Intention to stay quit even without winning a prize, a measure of intrinsic motivation, predicted both short- and long-term abstinence.

Social media, Web sites, and print material were used to promote the campaign message.<bold>Measures: </bold>Social media metrics and a street intercept postsurvey informed the campaign's success.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.<bold>Results: </bold>One hundred advertisements in English and Spanish were posted. After an 18-month followup, there were over 11,000 visits to the Facebook page. Results from the postsurvey (n = 171) suggest the SMC motivated participants who recognized the advertisements to improve their health behaviors.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>A multifaceted SMC that coincides with prevention programs can effectively raise attention to health issues and activities in a high-risk population at a relatively low cost.

Weight was objectively assessed with the Health Spot scale at baseline and 12-month follow-up.<bold>Analysis: </bold>The impact of HL on program effectiveness was assessed through fixed-effect parametric models that controlled for individual (i.e., age, gender, race, ethnicity, income, education) and worksite random effects.<bold>Results: </bold>Enrolled employees had significantly higher HL status [13.54 (1.68)] as compared to unenrolled [13.04 (2.17)] (p < .001). This finding was consistent in both interventions. Also, HL moderated weight loss effects (beta = .66; SE = 027; p = .014) and losing >5% weight (beta = -1.53; SE = .77; p < .047). For those with lower baseline HL, the INCENT intervention produced greater weight loss outcomes compared to LMW. The HL level of employees retained was not significantly different from those lost to follow-up.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>HL influences reach and moderates weight effects. These findings underscore the need to integrate recruitment strategies and further evaluate programmatic approaches that attend to the needs of low-HL audiences. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

The multivariate analysis of variance was significant (p < .001). A post hoc test showed that individuals in advanced SOC used more of both experiential and behavioral POC than those in preaction stages, with effect sizes ranging from .06 to .29.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This study supports the validity of the factorial structure of POC concerning physical activity and confirms the assumption that, in this context, people with excess weight use both experiential and behavioral processes. These preliminary results should be confirmed in a longitudinal study. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>We aimed to understand how employer characteristics relate to the use of incentives to promote participation in wellness programs and to explore the relationship between incentive type and participation rates. <bold>Design: </bold>A cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative survey data combined with an administrative business database was employed. <bold>Settings/subjects: </bold>Random sampling of U.S. companies within strata based on industry and number of employees was used to determine a final sample of 3000 companies. Of these, 19% returned completed surveys. <bold>Measures: </bold>The survey asked about employee participation rate, incentive type, and gender composition of employees. Incentive types included any incentives, high-value rewards, and rewards plus penalties. <bold>Analysis: </bold>Logistic regressions of incentive type on employer characteristics were used to determine what types of employers are more likely to offer which type of incentives. A generalized linear model of participation rate was used to determine the relationship between incentive type and participation. <bold>Results: </bold>Employers located in the Northeast were 5 to 10 times more likely to offer incentives. Employers with a large number of employees, particularly female employees, were up to 1.25 times more likely to use penalties. Penalty and high-value incentives were associated with participation rates of 68% and 52%, respectively. <bold>Conclusion: </bold>Industry or regional characteristics are likely determinants of incentive use for wellness programs. Penalties appear to be effective, but attention should be paid to what types of employees they affect. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To evaluate the effectiveness of FUEL Your Life, a translation of the Diabetes Prevention Program for worksites.<bold>Design: </bold>A randomized control group design was conducted in five worksites of a large transportation company. Measures were collected pretest, posttest (6 months), and follow-up (12 months).<bold>Setting: </bold>Railroad maintenance facilities of Union Pacific Railroad.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Participants consisted of 362 workers (227 treatment, 135 control).<bold>Intervention: </bold>FUEL Your Life was translated from the Diabetes Prevention Program to better fit within the context of the worksite. The primary difference was the use of peer health coaches to provide social support and reinforcement and an occupational nurse to provide lesson content (six sessions of 10 minutes) to participants instead of the lifestyle coaches employed by the Diabetes Prevention Program, resulting in a less structured meeting schedule.<bold>Measures: </bold>The primary outcomes were weight and body mass index (BMI), with secondary outcomes including eating behaviors, physical activity, and social support.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Latent growth modeling was used to measure changes in the outcomes over time.<bold>Results: </bold>Participants in the intervention group maintained weight/BMI (-.1 pounds/-.1 BMI), whereas the control participants gained weight/BMI (+2.6 pounds/+.3 BMI), resulting in a statistically significant difference between groups. Fifty-five percent of intervention participants lost some weight, whereas only 35% of the control group lost weight.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>FUEL Your Life, a low intensity intervention, was not effective for promoting weight loss, but was effective for helping workers maintain weight over a 12-month period.

Data from FDA are cross-sectional and we focused on usage and meaning of SS.<bold>Setting: </bold>United States.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Adults (18+ years).<bold>Measures: </bold>Both HDS and NHANES addressed how often participants used SS information and HDS also asked how SS is determined. Both NHANES and NFLES contained similar questions on the meaning of SS but NFLES also included an open-ended response option.<bold>Analysis: </bold>We included both quantitative and qualitative measures. Questions were analyzed by demographic variables and body mass index with frequencies, cross-tabulations, and χ(2) statistics reported.<bold>Results: </bold>HDS showed that the percentage of consumers who used SS information often or sometimes increased from 54% in 1994 to 64% in 2008. NHANES and NFLES data indicated that a majority of respondents had misinterpreted the meaning of SS. Women and obese individuals were more likely to use SS often or sometimes, but were also more likely to misinterpret the meaning of SS. A small subsample of NFLES participants expressed a distrust of the SS information.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>There is a widespread misunderstanding about SS, suggesting the need for clearer NF labels or enhanced education efforts.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Local food environments can influence the diet and health of individuals through food availability, proximity to retail stores, pricing, and promotion. This study focused on how small convenience stores, known in New York City as bodegas, influence resident shopping behavior and the food environment.<bold>Design: </bold>Using a cross-sectional design, 171 bodegas and 2118 shoppers were sampled.<bold>Setting: </bold>Small convenience stores in New York City.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Any bodega shopper aged 18+ who purchased food or beverage from a participating store.<bold>Measures: </bold>Data collection consisted of a store assessment, a health and behavior survey given to exiting customers, and a bag check that recorded product information for all customer purchases.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive statistics were generated for bodega store characteristics, shopper demographics, and purchase behavior. Multilevel models were used to assess the influence of product availability, placement, and advertising on consumer purchases of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), water, and fruits and vegetables.<bold>Results: </bold>Seventy-one percent of participants reported shopping at bodegas five or more times per week, and 35% reported purchasing all or most of their monthly food allotment at bodegas. Model results indicated that lower amounts of available fresh produce were significantly and independently associated with a higher likelihood of SSB purchases. A second, stratified multilevel model showed that the likelihood of purchasing an SSB increased with decreasing varieties of produce when produce was located at the front of the store. No significant effects were found for water placement and beverage advertising.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Small convenience stores in New York City are an easily accessible source of foods and beverages. Bodegas may be suitable for interventions designed to improve food choice and diet. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>In the United States, 36% of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers occur among men. HPV vaccination can substantially reduce the risk of HPV infection; however, the vast majority of men are unvaccinated. This study developed and validated transtheoretical model-based measures for HPV vaccination in young adult men.<bold>Design: </bold>Cross-sectional measurement development.<bold>Setting: </bold>Online survey of young adult men.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Three hundred twenty-nine mostly college-attending men, ages 18 to 26.<bold>Measures: </bold>Stage of change, decisional balance (pros/cons), and self-efficacy.<bold>Analysis: </bold>The sample was randomly split into halves for exploratory principal components analysis (PCA), followed by confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to test measurement models. Multivariate analyses examined relationships between scales.<bold>Results: </bold>For decisional balance, PCA revealed two uncorrelated five-item factors (pros α = .78; cons α = .83). For the self-efficacy scale, PCA revealed a single-factor solution (α = .83). CFA confirmed that the two-factor uncorrelated model for decisional balance and a single-factor model for self-efficacy. Follow-up analyses of variance supported the theoretically predicted relationships between stage of change, pros, and self-efficacy.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This study resulted in reliable and valid measures of pros and self-efficacy for HPV vaccination that can be used in future clinical research.

Risk factors for metabolic syndrome included blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and waist circumference.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Odds ratios (ORs) for having metabolic syndrome were calculated for men and women who met the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans compared to those who did not.<bold>Results: </bold>Women who did not meet the PA guidelines had significantly greater odds of having metabolic syndrome according to MVPAsr (OR = 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.65-2.94), MVPAa (OR = 4.40; 95% CI = 2.65-7.31), and MVPAb (OR = 2.91; 95% CI = 1.42-5.96). Men had significantly higher odds of having metabolic syndrome according to MVPAa (OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.91-3.45) and MVPAb (OR = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.55-5.17), but not MVPAsr. These ORs remained significant after adjusting for all potential confounders except body mass index, after which only MVPAsr in women and MVPAb in men remained significant.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Individuals who do not meet the PA guidelines exhibited greater odds of having metabolic syndrome. This relationship tended to be stronger for objective PA measures than for self-report. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Associations between neighborhood characteristics and neighborhood recreational walking were assessed using logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>Neighborhood recreational walking was associated with perceptions of the presence of recreational facilities (odds ratio [OR] = 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29-4.84), interesting things to see (OR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.46-5.45), and others being active (OR = 3.56, 95% CI = 1.80-7.05), and was inversely associated with concerns about crime (OR = .40, 95% CI = .20-.77) and traffic (OR = .43, 95% CI = .22-.87). This behavior was associated with objectively measured presence of walking trails (OR = 3.58, 95% CI = 1.07-4.46), percentage of street length with speed limits ≤25 mph (OR = 1.31 for 10% increase, 95% CI = 1.08-1.61), and percentage of tree canopy coverage (OR = 1.55 for 10% increase, 95% CI = 1.12-2.14).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Recreational walking may be influenced by environmental factors that support a safe, enjoyable, and social experience, attributes that are not necessarily prioritized in transportation walking. Outcome and exposure specificity are important when studying recreational walking. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Worksite wellness, safety, and violence prevention programs have low penetration among small, independent businesses. This study examined barriers and strategies influencing small business participation in workplace violence prevention programs (WVPPs).<bold>Approach: </bold>A semistructured interview guide was used in 32 telephone interviews.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study took place at the University of North Carolina Injury Prevention Research Center.<bold>Participants: </bold>Participating were a purposive sample of 32 representatives of small business-serving organizations (e.g., business membership organizations, regulatory agencies, and economic development organizations) selected for their experience with small businesses.<bold>Intervention: </bold>This study was designed to inform improved dissemination of Crime Free Business (CFB), a WVPP for small, independent retail businesses.<bold>Methods: </bold>Thematic qualitative data analysis was used to identify key barriers and strategies for promoting programs and services to small businesses.<bold>Results: </bold>Three key factors that influence small business engagement emerged from the analysis: (1) small businesses' limited time and resources, (2) low salience of workplace violence, (3) influence of informal networks and source credibility. Identified strategies include designing low-cost and convenient programs, crafting effective messages, partnering with influential organizations and individuals, and conducting outreach through informal networks.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Workplace violence prevention and public health practitioners may increase small business participation in programs by reducing time and resource demands, addressing small business concerns, enlisting support from influential individuals and groups, and emphasizing business benefits of participating in the program.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Screening rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) lag for low-income, minority populations, contributing to poorer survival rates. A model of storytelling as culture-centric health promotion was tested for promoting CRC screening.<bold>Design: </bold>A two-group parallel randomized controlled trial.<bold>Setting: </bold>Primary care, safety-net clinics.<bold>Subjects: </bold>Low-income patients due for CRC screening, ages 50 to 75 years, speaking English or Spanish.<bold>Intervention: </bold>Patients were exposed to either a video created from personal stories composited into a drama about "Papa" receiving CRC screening, or an instrument estimating level of personal cancer risk. Patients received a health care provider referral for CRC screening and were followed up for 3 months to document adherence.<bold>Measures: </bold>Behavioral factors related to the narrative model (identification and engagement) and theory of planned behavior.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Main effects of the interventions on screening were tested, controlling for attrition factors, and demographic factor associations were assessed. Path analysis with model variables was used to test the direct effects and multiple mediator models.<bold>Results: </bold>Main effects on CRC screening (roughly half stool-based tests, half colonoscopy) did not indicate significant differences (37% and 42% screened for storytelling and risk-based messages, respectively; n = 539; 33.6% male; 62% Hispanic). Factors positively associated with CRC screening included being female, Hispanic, married or living with a partner, speaking Spanish, having a primary care provider, lower income, and no health insurance. Engagement, working through positive attitudes toward the behavior, predicted CRC screening.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>A storytelling and a personalized risk-tool intervention achieved similar levels of screening among unscreened/underscreened, low-income patients. Factors usually associated with lower rates of screening (e.g., no insurance, being Hispanic) were related to more adherence. Both interventions' engagement factor facilitated positive attitudes about CRC screening associated with behavior change. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Objective: </bold>This review synthesizes the published literature on using mass media campaigns to reduce youth tobacco use, with particular focus on effects within population subgroups and the relative effectiveness of campaign characteristics.<bold>Data Source: </bold>A search of PubMed and PsycINFO conducted in March of 2014 yielded 397 studies with 34 suitable for inclusion.<bold>Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: </bold>Included were quantitative studies that evaluate an antitobacco media campaign intended to influence youth cognitions or behavior or explore the relative effectiveness of campaign characteristics among youth.<bold>Data Extraction: </bold>An automated search and assessment of suitability for inclusion was done.<bold>Data Synthesis: </bold>Study outcomes were compared and synthesized.<bold>Results: </bold>Antitobacco media campaigns can be effective across racial/ethnic populations, although the size of the campaign effect may differ by race/ethnicity. Evidence is insufficient to determine whether campaign outcomes differ by socioeconomic status (SES) and population density. Youth are more likely to recall and think about advertising that includes personal testimonials; a surprising narrative; and intense images, sound, and editing. Evidence in support of using a health consequences message theme is mixed; an industry manipulation theme may be effective in combination with a health consequences message. Research is insufficient to determine whether advertising with a secondhand smoke or social norms theme influences youth tobacco use.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Our recommendation is to develop antitobacco campaigns designed to reach all at-risk youth, which can be effective across racial/ethnic populations. Research priorities include assessing campaign influence among lower SES and rural youth, disentangling the effects of message characteristics, and assessing the degree to which this body of evidence may have changed as a result of changes in youth culture and communication technology.

Primary outcomes were weight and HbA1c, and moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity via accelerometer. Secondary outcomes were dietary energy intake and diet quality via a validated questionnaire.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Analyses employed were bivariate associations of call completion with sociodemographics, and confounder-adjusted linear mixed models for associations of call completion with outcomes (multiple imputation of missing data).<bold>Results: </bold>Only previous diagnosis of depression/anxiety had a statistically significant (p = .008) association with call completion. Call completion was significantly associated with weight loss (p < .001) but not the other outcomes (p > .05). Relative to low call completion, mean weight loss (as a percentage of baseline weight) was greater in the high-call completion group by -3.3% (95% confidence interval, -5.0% to -1.5%).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Increased dose of intervention was associated with greater weight loss. More needs to be done to retain patients for the duration of weight loss and behavior change interventions, particularly those with diabetes and comorbid depression, who were the most difficult to engage.

The timing of message receipt was categorized as early (preconceptionally and prenatally) or late (prenatally only/never).<bold>Analysis: </bold>Weighted χ (2) tests and multivariable logistic regression were used for analysis.<bold>Results: </bold>Among n = 3446, women with unintended pregnancies received all messages, except safe medications, significantly more early vs. late compared with women intending pregnancies (all p < .01). In multivariable analyses, there were no significant associations between timing of receipt and pregnancy intention, parity, preconception insurance status, or adequacy of prenatal care for any of the health messages. Hispanic women had increased odds of receiving the messages early compared with non-Hispanic white women, as did high school graduates vs. women with more education and women with lower household incomes vs. women with higher incomes.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Women who may be perceived to be at higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and/or engaging in high-risk behavior (minorities, lower education, lower income) appear to be getting messages early more often than do other women; messages are not reaching all women equally.

Most adults (71%) agreed that sports drinks contain sugar; however, this agreement was not significantly associated with adults' sports drink consumption. The odds of drinking sports drinks ≥1 times/wk were significantly higher among younger adults aged 18 to 64 years (OR range: 5.46-2.71), males (OR = 2.09), high-school graduates (OR = 1.52), and highly active adults (OR = 2.09).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>There were disparities in sports drink consumption by sociodemographic characteristics and physical activity level; however, knowledge of sports drinks' sugar content was not associated with consumption. Understanding why some population groups are higher consumers may assist in the development of education, providing those groups with a better understanding of sports drinks' nutritional value and health consequences of excessive sugar consumption in any form.

Qualitative data were collected monthly.<bold>Setting: </bold>Administrative and academic departments at a higher education institution in Massachusetts, United States.<bold>Participants: </bold>Five female administrative office workers.<bold>Method: </bold>One monthly group interview and one personal interview per participant during 6 months. Emerging topics from previous interviews were used in successive data gatherings. Transcribed data were manually coded according to the predefined topics of usability, comfort, safety, and productivity.<bold>Results: </bold>The setup of the work station, communication difficulties while walking (disrespectful, noisy), and peer pressure to maximize use were the main usability barriers. There was no event of falls. Trips were minimized. About comfort, subjects reported it hard to get used to prolonged standing position during the first month. Treadmill speed affected productivity mostly while drawing and working in spreadsheets. Lack of job autonomy was revealed as a generic barrier.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>In this female group, treadmill workstations had serious design problems for workers with not enough control of their jobs. The early identification and removal of barriers likely needs to be considered when offering these workstations to workers with low job autonomy. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To elucidate factors that impact intention (INT) to be active as well as actual physical activity (PA) behavior in colorectal cancer survivors (CRC-S) using the theory of planned behavior (TpB). Planning for PA was explored as a mediator of the INT-behavior relationship. Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and fatigue were also explored.<bold>Design: </bold>A cross-sectional quantitative mailed survey was used.<bold>Setting: </bold>The study was conducted among community-dwelling adults living in Pennsylvania when diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC).<bold>Subjects: </bold>Subjects comprised 843 CRC-S diagnosed with CRC in Pennsylvania in 2009.<bold>Measures: </bold>The survey included questions about planning for PA, TpB constructs, medical and social variables, and PA as measured by a modified Godin Leisure Time Questionnaire.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample. A mediation analysis was used to determine if planning mediated the relationship between INT and actual PA behavior. A stepwise regression was used to determine predictors of INT and PA.<bold>Results: </bold>Ninety-six CRC-S responded, with 25% meeting PA recommendations for health promotion, suggesting that CRC-S are insufficiently active. Perceived behavioral control (PBC) and social norm (SN) accounted for 43% of the variance in INT, whereas 30% of the variance in PA was explained by PBC and age. Neuropathy negatively impacted PA behavior (p = .008). Both action and coping planning partially mediated the INT-behavior relationship (β = 20.08, p = .007; β = 22.85, p = .001, respectively).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Survivors at risk for inactivity are those with low PBC, low SN, and neuropathy, and those who are older.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To test the effects of a physical-cognitive exercise intervention on gait parameters under dual-task conditions in community-dwelling older adults. <bold>Design: </bold>A repeated-measures quasi-experimental design, with control and exercise groups, was used. <bold>Setting: </bold>Study participants consist of a convenience sample recruited from senior citizens' centers in Monterrey, Mexico. <bold>Subjects: </bold>A total of 143 sedentary participants ages 65 to 92 years per group participated. <bold>Intervention: </bold>A combined 45- to 60-minute program of physical and cognitive exercises was conducted in three weekly sessions during 12 weeks for the exercise group. Measures . The spatial gait parameters of speed (cm/s), step width, and stride length (cm); and the temporal parameters of single and double support time, cadence (steps per minute), and swing time(s) were measured using the GaitRite. Counting backwards or naming animals represented cognitive performance. <bold>Analysis: </bold>Two (groups: exercise group vs. control group) by three (time: baseline, week 6, and week 12) repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was applied. <bold>Results: </bold>Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance revealed a significant group effect (Wilks lambda F4,279 = 6.78, p < .001); univariate analysis showed significant differences for gait speed (m/s), stride length, cadence, step width, and double support time. Time-by-group interaction showed significance in gait speed and stride length. <bold>Conclusion: </bold>The exercise group participants showed increased gait speed, cadence, and stride length, and reduced their step width and time spent with both feet on the ground. Walking while simultaneously performing a cognitive task might prepare older adults for competing/interfering demands from their environments. The protective health benefits of this intervention remain to be investigated. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- This article briefly describes how to structure a program evaluation to embrace the ROAR Factor. ROAR stands for return on allocated resources, which implies that we need to measure ALL the allocated resources, not just direct out-of-pocket costs, and ALL the returns, not just reductions in medical costs or similar objective outcomes. The ROAR Factor also means focusing programs on what makes people feel great, what makes them leant to roar, and measuring how well we are doing in helping people feel great. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Quantitative and observational. Setting. A midsized northeastern. university. Subjects. Convenience sample of 827 male, and female college students age 18 to 24 years. Measures. International Physical Activity Questionnaire and a PA stage-of-change algorithm. Analysis. A sequential process of survey development, including item generation and data reduction analyses by factor analysis, was followed with the goal of creating a parsimonious questionnaire. Structured equation modeling was used for confirmatory factor analysis and construct validation was confirmed against self-reported. PA and stage of change. Validation analyses were replicated in a second, independent sample of 1032 college students. Residts. Fifteen items reflecting PA self-regulation, outcome expectations, and personal barriers explained 65% of the questionnaire data and explained 28.6% and 39.5% of the variance in total PA and moderate-to-vigorous-intensily PA, respectively. Scale scores were distinguishable across the stages of change. Findings were similar when the Cognitive Behavioral Physical Activity Questionnaire (CBPAQ) was tested in a similar and independent sample of college students (40%; if moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA= .40; p < .001). Conclusion. The CBPAQ successfully explains and predicts PA behavior in a college population, warranting its incorporation intofuture studies aiming at understanding and improving on PA behavior in college students.

AB- Purpose. We investigated associations of acculturation with various types of activity (moderatevigorous leisure-time physical activity [LTPA], moderate-vigorous work- and transportation-related physical activity, and sedentary activity), and whether these activities mediated the acculturation-obesity association among Mexican-Americans. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2010. Subjects. Mexican-American NHANES participants aged ≥ 20 years (n = 1902). Measures. Demographic characteristics, physical activity, sedentary behavior, acculturation, and body mass index. Analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate associations of acculturation with categories of self-reported activity. Path analysis was used to test whether the activity measures mediated acculturation-obesity associations. Results. In adjusted models, compared to U.S.-born Mexican-Americans, foreign-bom Mexican- Americans living in the United States for less than 10 years were significantly less likely to be in the highest LTPA and sedentary activity categories, and more likely to be in the highest total and transportation activity categories. Foreign-bom Mexican-Americans living in the United States for 10 years or more were significantly less likely to engage in high sedentary activity but more likely to engage in high transportation activity. Sedentary behavior was the strongest mediator of the acculturation-obesity association, accounting for 40.7% and 57.1% of the total effect of acculturation on obesity among foreign-bom Mexican- Americans living in the United Slates for less than 10 years and for 10 years or more, respectively, compared to U.S.-born Mexican-Americans. Conclusion. Reducing sedentary behavior may lower the negative impact of acculturation on obesity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study examined municipal officials' participation in built environment policy initiatives focused on land use design, transportation, and parks and recreation. Design. Web-based cross-sectional survey. Setting. Eighty-three municipalities zuith 50,000 or more residents in eight states. Subjects. Four hundred fifty-three elected and appointed municipal officials. Measures. Outcomes included self-reported participation in land use design, transportation, and parks and recreation policy to increase physical activity. Independent variables included respondent position; perceptions of importance, barriers, and beliefs regarding physical activity and community design and layout; and physical activity partnership participation. Analysis. Multivariable, logistic regression models. Results. Compared to other positions, public health officials had lower participation in land use design (78.3% vs. 29.0%), transportation (78.1% vs. 42.1%), and parks and recreation (67.1% vs. 26.3%) policy. Perceived limited staff was negatively associated with participation in each policy initiative. Perceptions of the extent to which physical activity was considered in community design and physical activity partnership participation were positively associated with participation in each. Perceived lack of collaboration was associated with less land use design and transportation policy participation, and awareness that community design affects physical activity was associated with more participation. Perceived lack of political will was associated with less parks and recreation policy participation. Conclusion. Public health officials are underrepresented in built environment policy initiatives. Improving collaborations may improve municipal officials' policy participation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Poorly managed stress leads to detrimental physical and psychological consequences that have implications for individual and community health. Evidence indicates that U.S. adults predominantly use unhealthy strategies for stress management. This study examines the impact of a community-based mindfulness training program on stress reduction. Design. This study used a one-group pretestfosttest design. Setting. The study took place at the UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center in urban Los Angeles. Subjects. A sample of N = 127 community residents (84% Caucasian, 74% female) were included in the study. Intervention. Participants received mindfulness training through the Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs) for Daily Living I. Measures. Mindfulness, self-compassion, and perceived stress were measured at baseline and postintervention. Analysis. Paired-sample t-tests were used to test for changes in outcome measures from baseline to postintervention. Hierarchical regression analysis was fit to examine whether change in self-reported mindfulness and self-compassion predicted postintervention perceived stress scores. Results. There were statistically significant improvements in self-reported mindfulness (t = -10.67, p < .001, d - .90), self-compassion (t = -8.50, p < .001, d = .62), and perceived stress It - 9.28, p < . 001, d = -.78) at postintervention. Change in self-compassion predicted postintervention perceived stress (P = --44, t = -5.06, p < .001), but change in mindfulness did not predict postintervention perceived stress (P = - .0 4 , t = -.41, p = .68). Conclusion. These results indicate that a community-based mindfulness training program can lead to reduced levels of psychological stress. Mindfulness training programs such as MAPs may offer a promising approach for general public health promotion through improving stress management in the urban community. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The purposes of this study were to assess the effect of restricting school choice on changes in travel distance to school and transportation mode for elementary school students. Design. Study design was pre-post (spring 2010-fall 2010) quasi-experimental. Setting. Study setting was all public elementary schools in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Subjects. Subjects comprised approximately 20,500 students across 39 schools. Intervention. Study assessed a school choice policy change that restricted school choice to a school closer to the family's home. Measures. School district transportation data ivere used to determine distance to school. Direct observations of student travel modes (two morning and two afternoon commutes at each time point) were used to assess transportation mode. Analysis. Chi-square and independent-sample t-tests were calculated to describe the schools. Repeated measures general linear models ivere used to assess changes in travel distance to school and observed commuting behavior. Results. Distance to school significantly decreased (1.83 A .48 miles to 1.74 ± .46 miles; p = . 002). We failed to observe any significant changes in morning (+.7%) or afternoon (-.7%) active commuting (both p = .08) or the number of automobiles in the morning (-7 autos per school; p = .06) or afternoon (+3 autos per school; p = .14). Conclusion. The more restrictive school choice policy decreased distance to school but had no significant effect on active commuting. Policy interventions designed to increase active commuting to school may require additional time to gain traction and progr ammatic support to induce changes in behavior. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine predictors for persistent overweight/obesity, deteriorated weight status, and improved weight status among students who participated in a school-based obesity prevention intervention from fa ll 2009 to spring 2011. Design. Longitudinal assessment of a school-based cohort was conducted to determine the characteristics of students who remained overweight./obese, improved their weight status, or showed deteriorated weight status during an 18-month period. Setting. Eleven schools in southern Indiana, northwestern Kentucky, and southeastern Illinois. Subjects. N = 5309 students in 4th through 12th grade. Measures. Weight, height, and self-reported physical activity and nutrition behaviors of students were measured at baseline and 6, 12, and 18 months. Analysis. SAS 9.3 teas employed to examine predictors for the three different weight categories using logistic regression. Results. Low socioeconomic status (SES) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.56 and p < .001, AOR = 1.35 and p = .0069, respectively) and higher soda intake (AOR= 1.07 and p = .0016, AOR= 1.08 and p= .0278, respectively) increased the odds of belonging to persistent overweight/obesity (30.6%) and deteriorated weight status (6.9%), compared to the persistent nonoverweight status group. Conclusion. While. SES is an important determinant of weight category change, students' screen time and soda consumption may be important factors. Schools and families may be able to successfully focus on these modifiable risk factors, decreasing the burden of childhood obesity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To develop a reliable observational data collection instrument to measure characteristics of the fast-food restaurant environment likely to influence consumer behaviors, including product availability, pricing, and promotion. Design. The study used observational data collection. Setting. Restaurants were in the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area. Subjects. A total of 131 chain fast-food restaurant outlets were included. Measures. Interrater reliability was measured for product availability, pricing, and promotion measures on a fast-food restaurant observational data collection instrument. Analysis. Analysis was done with Cohen's k coefficient and proportion of overall agreement for categorical variables and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for continuous variables. Results. Interrater reliability, as measured by average K coefficient, was . 79 for menu characteristics, .84 for kids' menu characteristics, .92 for food availability and sizes, .85 for beverage availability and sizes, .78 for measures on the availability of nutrition information, .75 for characteristics of exterior advertisements, and .62 and .90 for exterior and interior characteristics measures, respectively. For continuous measures, average ICC was .88 for food pricing measures, .83 for beverage prices, and .65 for counts of exterior advertisements. Conclusion. Over 85% of measures demonstrated substantial or almost perfect agreement. Although some measures required revision or protocol clarification, results from this study suggest that the instrument may be used to reliably measure the fast-food restaurant environment.

AB- Purpose. Examine whether concurrently consuming a healthy diet and regularly being physically active among U.S. youth is more favorably associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarkers than other physical activity and dietary patterns. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. United States (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 2003-2006. Subjects. Two thousand six hundred twenty-nine youth (6-17 years). Measures. Healthy Eating Index (HEI), accelerometer-determined physical activity, biomarkers, and anthropometry. Four categories were created: consuming a healthy diet (top 40% of HEI) and active (sufficient to meet guidelines); unhealthy diet and active; healthy diet and inactive; and unhealthy diet and inactive. Analysis. Multivariable regression. Results. Children consuming a healthy diet and who were active had significantly lower waist circumference (β = -5.5 , p < .006), C-reactive protein (CRP) (β = -.2 , p < .006), and triglycerides (β = -27.9 , p < .006) than children consuming an unhealthy diet and who were inactive. Children engaging in both healthy behaviors had significantly lower CRP (β = -.11, p < .001) and total cholesterol levels (β = -7.8, p = .004) than those only engaging in sufficient activity; there were no significant differences in biomarker levels among children engaging in both healthy behaviors and those only consuming a healthy diet. No associations were significant for adolescents. Conclusion. Concurrent healthy eating and regular physical activity among children is favorably associated with CVD biomarkers when compared with unhealthy diet and inactivity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To validate performance indicators for evaluating workplace health promotion (WHP) programs based on a logic model and to analyze the structural relationships between constructs. Design. The study design is cross-sectional. Setting. Design setting was small manufacturing companies implementing WHP programs provided by the Korea Industrial Health Association. Subjects. Seventeen occupational health experts completed a questionnaire to determine the content validity of indicators. In addition, 58 health care managers completed a questionnaire to determine reliability and construct validation. The response rate, was 84.1%. Measures. Based on a logic model, 13 constructs of WHP programs were identified: WHP program input, four activities for workplace environment management, two activities for employee health care management, two outputs, and two short-torn outcomes. Analysis. Interrater agreement index was used for testing the content validity of indicators. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test for the reliabilities, and the convergent and discriminant validities. Structuring equation modeling was also used to analyze the relationships among constructs. Results. A total of 35 performance indicators from 11 constructs showed good reliability and validity. All relationships among WHP input, activities, outputs, and short-term outcomes were significant, except for the relationship between environment outputs and short-term outcome. Conclusion. These findings illustrate that the logic model and structuring equation modeling can be used to develop and validate performance indicators for planning and evaluation of the WHP program.

AB- Purpose. First-degree relatives (FDRs) of prostate cancer (PC) patients should consider multiple concurrent personal risk factors when engaging in informed decision making (IDM) about PC screening. This study assessed perceptions of IDM recommendations and risk-appropriate strategies for IDM among FDRs of varied race/ethnicity. Design. A cross-sectional, qualitative study design was used. Setting. Study setting was a cancer center in southwest Florida. Participants. The study comprised 44 participants (24 PC patients and 20 unaffected FDRs). Method. Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted and analyzed using content analysis and constant comparison methods. Results. Patients and FDRs found the PC screening debate and IDM recommendations to be complex and counterintuitive. They overwhelmingly believed screening saves lives and does not have associated harms. There was a strongly expressed need to improve communication between patients and FDRs. A single decision aid that addresses the needs of all FDRs, rather than one separating by race/ethnicity, was recommended as sufficient by study participants. These perspectives guided the development of an innovative decision aid that deconstructs the screening controversy and IDM processes into simpler concepts and provides step-by-step strategies for FDRs to engage in IDM. Conclusion. Implementing IDM among FDRs is challenging because the IDM paradigm departs from historical messages promoting routine screening. These contradictions should be recognized and addressed for men to participate effectively in IDM. A randomized pilot study evaluating outcomes of the resulting decision aid is underway.

AB- Purpose. Study goals were to (1) understand the attitudes of employees in low-wage industries toward workplace health promotion, including views on appropriateness of employer involvement in employee health and level of interest in tuorkplace health promotion overall and in specific programs, and (2) determine the potential for extending workplace health promotion to spouses and partners of these employees. Approach. The study used 42 interviews of 60 to 90 minutes. Setting. Interviews were conducted with couples (married or living together) in the Seattle/ King County metropolitan area of Washington State. Participants. Study participants were forty-two couples xuith one or more members zuorking in one of five low-wage industries: accommodation/food services, education, health care/social assistance, manufacturing, and retail trade. Method. The study employed qualitative analysis of interview transcripts using grounded theory to identify themes. Results. Employees consider workplace health promotion both appropriate and desirable and believe it benefits employers through increased productivity and morale. Most have little personal experience with it and doubt their employers would prioritize employee health. Employees are most interested in efforts focused on nutrition and physical activity. Both employees and their partners support extending workplace health promotion to include partners. Conclusion. Employees and their partners are interested in workplace health promotion if it addresses behaviors they care about. Concern over employer involvement in their personal health decisions is minimal; instead, employees view employer interest in their health as a sign that they are valued. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To compare the retail distribution and density per population of electronic and conventional cigarettes in smoke-free communities with and without e-cigarette restrictions. Design. A cross-sectional study with field observations of retail tobacco stores. Setting. Two Central Kentucky counties with 100% smoke-free workplace regulations; counties selected on the basis of whether e-cigarette use was restricted. Subjects. Fifty-seven tobacco retailers in two counties, including conventional retailers and stand-alone e-cigarette stores. Measures. Type and location of store and products sold; addresses of stores and schools geocoded with ArcGIS. Analysis. Bivariate comparisons between counties, rates and confidence intervals for frequency of tobacco retailers and e-cigarette stores per population. Results. Fifty-three percent of tobacco retailers sold e-cigarettes. E-cigarette availability did not differ by whether smoke-free regulation covered e-cigarettes. Rates of tobacco retailers and e-cigarette distributors per 10,000 were 8.29 and 4.40, respectively, in the two-county area. Of the 40 schools, 88% had a tobacco retailer and 68% had an e-cigarette distributor within 1 mile. Conclusion. In this exploratory study, e-cigarette use restriction was not related to store availability. For a relatively new product, e-cigarettes were readily available in retail outlets and close to schools.

AB- Purpose. To examine the sociodemographic traits of adolescent e-cigarette users and whether e-cigarettes are used as cessation aids among adolescent smokers. Design. The study had a cross-sectional design. Setting. Study setting was the United States. Subjects. A probability sample of 15,264 adolescents in grades 6 through 12 was used. Measures. The study measured self-reported lifetime e-cigarette use and recent conventional cigarette use, desire to quit, and number of recent quit attempts (among conventional cigarette smokers), and factors hypothesized to be related to e-cigarette use (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, friendships with smokers). Analysis. Logistic regression was used to assess e-cigarette use among (1) all adolescents and (2) conventional cigarette smokers as a function of quit desire and attempts. Results. Descriptive analyses show 3.2% of respondents had used e-cigarettes. E-cigarette use is significantly lower for females (adjusted odds ratio [OR], .70), non-Hispanic black youth (adjusted OR, .37), and Mexican-American youth (adjusted OR, .56), and higher for those who smoke conventional cigarettes (adjusted OR, 58.44) or have friends who smoke (adjusted OR, 2.38). Among conventional cigarette smokers, neither desire to quit nor recent quit attempts is significantly associated with e-cigarette use. Conclusions. E-cigarette use is more common among certain adolescent subgroups than others and does not appear to be part of a cessation regimen among conventional cigarette smokers wishing to quit. More regulatory and prevention efforts are needed, especially for certain adolescent subpopulations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To describe the factors facilitating the implementation of heart health promotion programs for older adults in Anglican, United, and Catholic churches. Design. The study used qualitative methods comprising semistructured interviews and focus groups. Setting. The interviews and focus groups were conducted in Anglican, Catholic, and United churches located in the Canadian cities of Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario. Participants. Twelve ordained pastors and 21 older parishioners who attended church regularly and who had no health conditions were recruited to best explain how churches could be suitable locations for health promotion activities targeting older adults. Methods. Twelve semistructured interviews with the pastors and three focus groups with the 21 parishioners were undertaken. A component of the Precede-Proceed model (a model for planning health education and health promotion programs and policies) was applied to the findings after direct content analysis of the data. Results. Participants identified pastor leadership, funding for a parish nurse, community-focused interventions, secured infrastructure, and social support from congregation members as pertinent factors required for implementing health promotion programs in Anglican, United, and Catholic churches. Conclusion. The findings have particular relevance for health promotion and public health because they suggest factors that would be necessary to design church-based heart health promotion programs for older adults at risk of chronic diseases.

AB- Purpose. To investigate how a pilot environmental intervention changed food sales patterns in carryout restaurants. Design. Quasi-experimental. Setting. Low-income neighborhoods of Baltimore, Maryland. Subjects. Seven carryouts (three intervention, four comparison). Intervention. Phase 1, menu board revision and healthy menu labeling; phase 2, increase of healthy sides and beverages; and phase 3, promotion of cheaper and healthier combination meals. Measures. Weekly handwritten menu orders collected to assess changes in the proportion of units sold and revenue of healthy items (entrée, sides and beverages, and combined). Analysis. Logistic and Poisson regression models with generalized estimating equations. Results. In the intervention group, odds for healthy entrée units and odds for healthy side and beverage units sold significantly increased in phases 2 and 3; odds for healthy entrée revenue significantly increased in phase 1 (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.26), phase 2 (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.25-1.41), and phase 3 (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.14-1.70); and odds for healthy side and beverage revenues increased significantly in phase 2 (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.33-1.97) and phase 3 (OR 2.73, 95% CI 2.15-3.47) compared to baseline. Total revenue in the intervention group was significantly higher in all phases than in the comparison group (p < .05). Conclusion. Environmental intervention changes such as menu revision, menu labeling, improved healthy food selection, and competitive pricing can increase availability and sales of healthy items in carryouts.

AB- Purpose. To examine the role of pet play and dog walking in children's and adolescents' leisure time, and the relationship between these activities and physical activity. Design. The study design was observational. Setting. The study setting was metropolitan Perth and nonmetropolitan regions in Western Australia. Subjects. The study included 1097 primary school (mean age, 10.1 years; SD, 1.6 years) and 657 secondary school (mean age, 14.0 years; SD, 1.3 years) students. Measures. Validated measures of total physical activity, dog walking, and pet play activity (prevalence and time) were calculated. Analysis. Generalized linear models tested for differences between proportions, while adjusting for socioeconomic status, age, and school-level clustering. Results. Approximately one third of primary school and one quarter of secondary school students reported that they walked the dog at least once in the last week. Pet play was the most common play activity for primary and secondary school girls, and the second and third most popular play activity for secondary and primary school boys, respectively. Secondary school students who walked the dog or played with pets spent an average of 1 hour per week on each activity, and they were significantly more likely (p < .005) to meet national physical activity recommendations than secondary school students not reporting these activities. Conclusion. Given the significant proportion of young people who frequently engage in dog walking and pet play, and the high level of pet ownership in many Western countries, promotion of these activities to support young people's health is warranted.

AB- Purpose. To determine whether workload, job satisfaction, and flexible schedules are predictive of using time at work to exercise. Design. The study design was the quantitative analysis of the time at work to exercise intervention of a cluster-randomized controlled trial. Setting. The study took place at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. Subjects. Subjects comprised 188 full- and part-time faculty and staff (57% female). Intervention. Employees were randomized into different intervention groups, and analysis focused on employees who were provided 30 minutes of time at work to exercise. Measures. Time at work to exercise at was measured 9 months, and work environment characteristics were measured at baseline. ANALYSIS: Logistic regression modeling using generalized estimating equation analysis was used to account for departmental clustering. Results. Time at work to exercise was used by 45% of participants. Participants who felt comfortable taking time off work to exercise were 2.8 times more likely to use time to exercise than those who did not feel comfortable taking time off (95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 6.1). Participants who reported too much work were .3 times less likely to exercise (95% confidence interval: 0.2 to 0.7). Job satisfaction and the ability to take time off for personal matters were not significantly associated with using time to exercise. Conclusion. The results support the hypothesis that individuals with a supportive work environment would be more likely to use time at work to exercise. Workload and having time during the day are more important than job satisfaction. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this study is to establish the psychometric properties of 22 measures from a community-based participatory research (CBPR) conceptual model. Design. The design of this study was an online, cross-sectional survey of academic and community partners involved in a CPBR project. Setting. CPBR projects (294) in the United States with federal funding in 2009. Subjects. Of the 404 academic and community partners invited, 312 (77.2%) participated. Of the 200 principal investigators/project directors invited, 138 (69.0%) participated. Measures. Twenty-two measures of CBPR context, group dynamics, methods, and health-related outcomes were examined. Analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis to establish factorial validity and Pearson correlations to establish convergent and divergent validity were used. Results. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated strong factorial validity for the 22 constructs. Pearson correlations (p < .001) supported the convergent and divergent validity of the measures. Internal consistency was strong, with 18 of 22 measures achieving at least a .78 Cronbach α. Conclusion. CBPR is a key approach for health promotion in underserved communities and/or communities of color, yet the basic psychometric properties of CBPR constructs have not been well established. This study provides evidence of the factorial, convergent, and discriminant validity and the internal consistency of 22 measures related to the CBPR conceptual model. Thus, these measures can be used with confidence by both CBPR practitioners and researchers to evaluate their own CBPR partnerships and to advance the science of CBPR. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. Evaluate the literature on interventions targeting tertiary education staff within colleges and universities for improvements in health behaviors such as physical activity, dietary intake, and weight loss. Data Source. One online database, Medline, was searched for literature published between January 1970 and February 2013. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. All quantitative study designs, including but not limited to randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, nonrandomized experimental trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies, were eligible. Data Extraction. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer using a standardized form developed by the researchers. Extraction was checked for accuracy and consistency by a second reviewer. Data Synthesis. Data in relation to the above objective were extracted and described in a narrative synthesis. Results. Seventeen studies were identified that focused on staff within the tertiary education setting. The review yielded overall positive results with 13 reporting significant health-related improvements. Weight loss, physical activity and fitness, and/or nutrition were the focus in more than half (n = 9) of the studies. Conclusion. This appears to be the first review to examine health interventions for tertiary education staff. There is scope to enhance cross-disciplinary collaboration in the development and implementation of a ‘‘Healthy University’’ settings–based approach to health promotion in tertiary education workplaces. Universities or colleges could serve as a research platform to evaluate such intervention strategies. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. To systematically review health coaching interventions regarding effectiveness of health coaching for specific outcomes, optimal intervention approaches, and identification of specific techniques associated with effectiveness. Data Source. Articles were sourced from CINAHL, Global Health, PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, Health Source, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and Medline. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Randomized controlled trials were included if the study (1) employed health coaching according to a predefined criterion; (2) clearly reported the use of health coaching; or (3) incorporated the use of coaching. Data Extraction. Aims, participants, approach, behavior change techniques (BCTs), and findings pertaining to each study were summarized. BCTs were classified according to the CALO-RE taxonomy. Data Synthesis. Data were synthesized by cross-tabulation of BCTs with study outcomes. Results. Fifteen of 16 eligible studies reported a positive intervention effect in at least one outcome. Nine studies (56%) did not define health coaching; the number of intervention sessions provided ranged from 2 to 48; and in three studies, one or more intervention details were unclear. It was hence difficult to synthesize the studies to adequately address our research questions. Conclusion. Health coaching is a promising strategy for health improvements; however, future research should ensure clarity in reporting intervention details, clearer definitions of health coaching/theoretical bases, consistency in reporting BCTs, and the inclusion of process variables as outcome measures.

AB- Purpose. Participation in clinical trials (CTs) is low among rural communities. Investigators report difficulty recruiting rural individuals for CTs. The study purpose was to identify recruitment barriers, motivators, and strategies to help increase access to and participation in CTs in rural and urban communities. Approach. Qualitative focus groups/interviews. Setting. Rural and urban counties in one southeastern state. Participants. Two hundred twelve African-American and white men and women ages 21+. Method. Nineteen focus groups and nine interviews were conducted. Audio files were transcribed and organized into NVivolO. Recurring themes were examined by geographic location. Results. Although similar barriers, motivators, and strategies were reported by urban and rural groups, perceptions regarding their importance varied. Recruitment barriers mentioned in both rural and urban groups included fear, side effects, limited understanding, limited time, and mistrust. Rural groups were more mindful o f time commitment involved. Both rural and urban participants reported financial incentives as the lop motivator to CT participation, followed by personal illness (urban groups) and benefits to family (rural groups). Recruitment strategies suggested by rural participants involved working with schools/churches and using word of mouth, whereas partnering with schools, word of mouth, and media were recommended most by urban groups. Conclusion. Perceived recruitment barriers, motivators, and strategies did not differ considerably between rural and urban groups. Major barriers identified try participants should be addressed in future CT recruitment and education efforts. Findings can inform recruitment and communication strategies for reaching both urban and rural communities. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To investigate the perceptions, behaviors, and recommendations that paren ts, school nurses, and teachers have regarding children's use of eyeglasses. Approach. Focus groups with parents, school nurses, and teachers were conducted. Setting. The study took place in one Southern California school district. Participants. There were 39 participants, including 24 parents, seven school nurses, and eight teachers. Method. An experienced moderator guided the focus group discussions. Transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory techniques. Results. Participants perceive visual impairment as a serious problem in the development of children. The lack of eyeglasses may lead to problems such as tiredness, headaches, inability to focus on school work, and decreased reading speed. Participants experienced disappointment, unhappiness, wony, and concern when they realized they needed eyeglasses at a young age. Negative societal perceptions toward eyeglasses, lack of eye doctors in minority communities, parental perceptions that children do not need eyeglasses, and peer bullying of children wearing eyeglasses are key obstacles to children's use of eyeglasses. Participants suggest school and national campaigns featuring respected public figures who wear eyeglasses to promote positive attitudes toward eyeglasses. Conclusion. Parents and teachers who closely follow the academic development of children have observed that visual impairment has negative consequences for the scholastic achievement of children. They recommend interventions to promote the attractiveness of eyeglasses in society. The participants discuss the need for a national preventative message for eye care similar to the message for denial care. The public health message should emphasize the importance of embracing and respecting differences among individuals. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. To evaluate the use of behavioral economics to design financial incentives to promote health behavior change and to explore associations with demographic characteristics. Data Source. Studies performed by the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics at the University of Pennsylvania published between January 2006 and March 2014. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Randomized, controlled trials with available, participant-level data. Studies that did not use financial incentives to promote health behavior change were excluded. Data Extraction. Participant-level data from seven studies were pooled. Data Synthesis. Meta-analysis on the pooled sample using a random-effects model with interaction terms to examine treatment effects and whether they varied by incentive structure or demographic characteristics. Results. The pooled study sample comprised 1403 participants, of whom 35% were female, 70% were white, 24% were black, and the mean age was 48 years (standard deviation 11.2 years). In the fully adjusted model, participants offered financial incentives had higher odds of behavior change (odds ratio [OR]: 3.96; p < .01) when compared to control. There were no significant interactions between financial incentives and gender, age, race, income, or education. When further adjusting for incentive structure, blacks had higher odds than whites of achieving behavior change (OR: 1.67; p < .05) with a conditional payment. Compared to lower-income participants, higher-income participants had lower odds of behavior change (OR: 0.46; p = . 01) with a regret lottery. Conclusion. Financial incentives designed using concepts from behavioral economics were effective for promoting health behavior change. There were no large and consistent relationships between the effectiveness of financial incentives and observable demographic characteristics. Second-order examinations of incentive structure suggest potential relationships among the effectiveness of Jinancial incentives, incentive structure, and the demogr aphic characteristics of race and income.

AB- Purpose. To identify the influence of gender stereotypes on eating habits among Costa Rican adolescents. Design. Qualitative, descriptive research was used in this study. Setting. Adolescents and parents were recruited from socioeconomically diverse populations in rural and urban areas of San Jose, Costa Rica. Subjects. Subjects were 92 adolescents (14 to 17 years old) and 48 parents. Methods. Focus group data were transcribed and entered into the qualitative data analysis software Atlas.ti version 5.0. Analyses were grounded on the social cognitive theory. Results. Five themes emerged from the focus group discussions: (1) Costa Rican adolescents associate the consumption of moderate quantities of healthy foods with femininity and male homosexuality. (2) The consumption of hearty portions of nonhealthy foods was associated with masculinity and male heterosexuality. (3) There is an emerging view that it is acceptable for heterosexual male adolescents to take care of their bodies through healthy eating. (4) Body care among female adolescents is an element of femininity and body image. (5) Parents reinforce their daughters' persistent concern with weight control because they perceive it as feminine behavior. Conclusion. Flealth promoters should be aware of the existing and changing food stereotypes around gender as an avenue for the promotion of healthy eating. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Determine the effect of menu labels displaying the energy content of food items or the exercise equivalent on energy ordered and consumed at lunch and energy intake for the remainder of the day in young adults. Design. Subjects were randomized to a menu with no labels (no-labels), menu with kilocalorie labels displaying the energy content of the food items (kcal-labels), or menu with exercise labels displaying the minutes of brisk walking needed to bum the food energy (exercise-labels). Setting. The study was conducted in one dining area located in a metabolic kitchen at the Texas Christian University and another located in a residence occupied by gaduate students. Subjects. Of the 300 subjects, 55.7% were female, 77.3% were college students, 88% were while, and 88% were non-Hispanic. Mean body mass index and age were 24.2 ± 4.5 kg/m<Sup>2</Sup> and 21.9 ± 2.3 years, respectively. Intervention. All menus contained the same food/beverage choices. Subjects ordered and consumed foods/beverages for lunch from the menu to which they were assigned. Subjects were blinded to study purpose. Measures. Energy ordered and consumed at lunch were assessed from the weight of the. food ordered and consumed, respectively, and the energy content of the same foods available on the restaurant Web site. Postlunch energy intake was assessed by food recall. Analysis. Analysis of covariance, adjusted for premeal hunger levels and gender, determined the effect of menu type on energy ordered and consumed and postlunch energy intake. Results. Significant menu effect was observed for energy ordered (p= .008) and consumed (p= .04) at lunch. The exercise-labels group ordered significantly (p= .002) less energy (adjusted mean [confidence intervals]: 763 [703, 824] kcal) at lunch, compared to the no-labels group (902 [840, 963] kcal) but not compared, to the kcal-labels group (827 [766, 888] kcal). The exercise-labels group also consumed significantly (p= .01) less energy (673 [620, 725] kcal) at lunch, compared to the no-labels group (770 (717, 823) kcal) but not compared to the kcal-labels group (722 [669, 776] kcal). Energy ordered and consumed were not different between kcal-labels and no-labels groups. There was no difference in postlunch energy intake by menu type. Conclusion. The menu with exercise-labels resulted in less energy ordered and consumed and this did not lead to greater energy consumption post lunch, compared to the menu with no-labels in young adults largely made up of normal-weight, non-Hispanic white college, students.

AB- Purpose. This study assessed the relationship between television viewing time and measured cardiorespiratory fitness and the influence of various potential confounders. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. Intermountain West. Subjects. The sample was composed of 302 nonsmoking women aged 40.2 ± 3.0 years, with ~ 90% Caucasian and 82% married. Measures. TV viewing was assessed by using a questionnaire, and cardiorespiratory fitness was measured by using a graded, maximum treadmill test. Physical activity (PA) was evaluated by using accelerometers for 7 days, and body fat percentage (BF%) was measured by using the Bod Pod. Analysis. Analysis of variance and partial correlation. Results. VO<Sub>2</Sub>max of Frequent (⩾3 h/d) TV viewers (32.6 ± 6.4 mL/kg/min) was significantly loiver than that of both Moderate (1-2 h/d) (36.2 ± 7.2 mL/kg/min) or Infrequent (<1 h/d) (36.5 ± 6.5 mL/kg/min) viewers (F= 8.0, p = .0004). The Infrequent and Moderate groups did not differ in VO<Sub>2</Sub>max. Age, education, body mass index, and season of assessment had no influence on the relationship when controlled statistically. Adjusting for PA (F= 4.2, p = .0157) and BF% (F= 5.0, p = .0071) weakened the relationship by 59% and 58 %, respectively, but the relationships remained significant. After controlling for both PA and BF% simultaneously (F= 2.9, p = .0572), the relationship was weakened by 81 % and was only borderline significant. Conclusion. Female Frequent TV viewers have significantly lower cardiorespiratory fitness levels than Moderate or Infrequent viewers. This association appears to be largely a function of differences in levels of PA and BF%. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of objectively measured lifestyle light-intensity physical activity (LLPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) ivith various biological markers and chronic diseases among a nationally representative sample of U.S. older adults (63+ years). Design. A cross-sectional design was used for this study. Setting. Data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006. Subjects. Subjects were 1,496 older U.S. adults. Measures. Participants wore an accelerometer for at least 4 days and completed questionnaires to assess sociodemographics and, chronic disease information. Blood samples were taken to assess biological markers. Analysis. Adjusted Wald tests and Poisson regression were used to examine the association of LLPA and MVPA with biological markers and chronic disease. Results. Older adults engaging in ⩾300 min/wk of LLPA had lower observed values for body mass index, waist circumference, C-reactive protein, and insulin resistance compared to those engaging in <300 min/wk of LLPA. Additionally, those engaging in <300 min/wk of LLPA had a rate 1.18 times greater for having chronic disease compared to those engaging in ⩾300 min/iuk of LLPA. Conclusion. In this national sample of older U.S. adults, participation in at least 300 min/ wk of LLPA was associated with more favorable health outcomes. Future experimental studies are warranted to confirm these findings. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To identify independent patterns of diet using factor analysis to determine the extent to which dietary patterns account for differences in body fat percentage (BF%) and body mass index (BMI). Also, to ascertain the extent to which the associations are influenced by age, education, menopause, energy intake, and physical activity. Design. Study design was cross-sectional. Setting. Study setting was approximately 20 cities in the Mountain West. Subjects. The study included 281 apparently healthy female nonsmokers. Measures. Diet was assessed using 7-day weighed food records, and foods were categorized using the American Diabetes and American Dietetic Associations Exchange Lists and expressed as servings per 1000 kcal. BF% was measured using the Bod Pod, and physical activity was estimated using accelerometers worn for 1 week. Analysis. We used factor analysis, general linear models, and partial correlations. Results. Three dietary patterns were identified: (1) Prudent Pattern, (2) Low-fat Milk, and (3) Meat. Higher consumption of the Prudent Pattern corresponded with significantly lower BF% (F = 8.5, p = .0038) and BMI (F = 4.4, p = .0363). The Low-fat Milk pattern was inversely related to BF% (F = 5.4, p = .0207) and BMI (F = 9.5, p = .0023). Higher intake of the Meat pattern was related to higher levels of BF% (F = 4.5, p = 0346) and BMI (F = 4.2, p = .0418). Conclusion. These findings support an association between dietary patterns and body composition. Dietary patterns reflect the complex interrelationships inherent in day-to-day eating and are strongly related to differences in BF% and BMI in women. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To compare concurrent criterion validity of the Self-Reported Fitness (SRFit) Survey, a new fitness measure, between black and white race, gender, and health literacy groups. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. Midwest urban primary care center and commercial fitness center. Subjects. One hundred one black, white, male, and female primary care patients aged ≥ 40 years. Measures. Measures included demographics, the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine, the SRFit Survey, and the Rikli and Jones Senior Fitness Test battery of physical tests. The BodPod determined percentage of body fat. Body mass index was calculated. Analysis. Concurrent validity was assessed using Pearson and Spearman rank order correlations between corresponding physical tests and SRFit survey items. Results. Correlations between physical tests and SRFit items ranged from r = .52 to .76 (ρ = .4 1 -8 5 ) in males, r = .40 to .79 (ρ = .3 3 -8 0 ) in females, r = .45 to .79 (ρ = .5 3 -8 2 ) in blacks, and r= .49 to . 77 (ρ = .3 3 -8 2 ) in whites. Correlations were r= .58 (ρ = .58) to r= .77 (ρ = .79) in persons with low health literacy and r= .50 to .79 (ρ = ,39-.85) among persons with moderate to high health literacy. Conclusion. SRFit shows similar concurrent validity across race, gender, and health literacy subgroups. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the association between soft drink consumption and risk of weight gain over 4 years. Also, determine if the relationship between soft drink intake and weight gain is a result of differences in calorie intake or physical activity (PA), or other potential mediating factors. Design. Four-year prospective cohort. Setting. Approximately 20 cities in Utah and Wyoming. Subjects. One hundred seventy nonsmoking, apparently healthy women. Measures. At baseline, soft drink consumption and menopause status were measured using a questionnaire; calorie intake was estimated using 7-day, weighed food records; and PA was assessed using 7-day accelerometer data. Weight was assessed using an electronic scale at baseline and follow-up. Analysis. Multiple regression and partial correlation. Results. Four-year weight gain in participants who, at baseline, consumed sugar-sweetened soft drinks (2.7 ± 5.1 kg) was greater than in participants who consumed artificially sweetened soft drinks (--.1 ± 4.4 kg) or no soft drinks (.5 ± 5.1 kg) (F= 5.4, p = .022). Adjusting for objectively measured PA had no effect on risk of weight gain. However, controlling statistically for differences in calorie intake significantly weakened the relationship between soft drink consumption and weight gain by 28% . Conclusion. Consuming artificially sweetened soft drinks or no soft drinks instead of sugar-sweetened soft drinks may help to reduce risk of weight gain in women. The relationship appears to be partly a function of differences in calorie intake, but not differences in PA. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This article describes lessons from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiative encompassing sodium reduction interventions in six communities. Design. A multiple case study design was used. Setting. This evaluation examined data from programs implemented in six communities located in New York (Broome County, Schenectady County, and New York City); California (Los Angeles County and Shasta County); and Kansas (Shawnee County). Subjects. Participants (n = 80) included program staff, program directors, state-level staff, and partners. Measures. Measures for this evaluation included challenges, facilitators, and lessons learned from implementing sodium reduction strategies. Analysis. The project team conducted a document review of program materials and semistructured interviews 12 to 14 months after implementation. The team coded and analyzed data deductively and inductively. Results. Five lessons for implementing community-based sodium reduction approaches emerged: (1) build relationships with partners to understand their concerns, (2) involve individuals knowledgeable about specific venues early, (3) incorporate sodium reduction efforts and messaging into broader nutrition efforts, (4) design the program to reduce sodium gradually to take into account consumer preferences and taste transitions, and (5) identify ways to address the cost of lower-sodium products. Conclusion. The experiences of the six communities may assist practitioners in planning community-based sodium reduction interventions. Addressing sodium reduction using a community-based approach can foster meaningful change in dietary sodium consumption. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine whether a plant-based nutrition program in a multicenter, corporate setting improves depression, anxiety, and productivity. Design. A quasi-experimental study examined the impact of diet on emotional well-being and productivity. Setting. The study was conducted in 10 corporate sites of a major U.S. insurance company. Subjects. There were 292 participants (79.8% women, 20.2% men), with body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2 and/or previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Intervention. Either weekly instruction in following a vegan diet or no instruction was given for 18 weeks. Measures. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Short Form-36 questionnaire. Work productivity was measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire. Analysis. Baseline characteristics were examined by t-test for continuous variables and x2 test for categorical variables. Analysis of covariance models were adjusted for baseline covariates. Paired t-tests were used to determine within-group changes and t-tests for between group differences. Results. In an intention-to-treat analysis, improvements in impairment because of health (p < .001), overall work impairment because of health (p= .02), non-work-related activity impairment because of health (p < .001), depression (p = .02), anxiety (p = .04), fatigue (p < .001), emotional well-being (p = .01), daily functioning because of physical health (p = .01), and general health (p= 0.02) in the intervention group were significantly greater than in the control group. Results were similar for study completers. Conclusion. A dietary intervention improves depression, anxiety, and productivity in a multicenter, corporate setting. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Energy drinks are growing in popularity among youth because of their stimulant properties. However, they can increase blood pressure and are associated with serious consequences such as cardiac arrest. This study examined the associations between energy drink perceptions and energy drink consumption among youth. Design. The design was a cross-sectional study using the YouthStyles Survey 2011. Setting. The online survey was administered at home. Subjects. Subjects were youths aged 12 to 17 years in the summer of 2011 (n = 779). Measures. Energy drink consumption, perceptions about energy drinks, and sociodemographic and behavioral variables were measured. Analysis. Chi-square and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used. Results. Overall, 9% of youth drank energy drinks, 19.5% agreed that energy drinks are safe drinks for teens, and 12.5% agreed that energy drinks are a type of sports drink. The proportion of youth consuming energy drinks once per week or more was highest among youth aged 16 to 17 years and among those who are physically active three to six times a week. The odds for drinking energy drinks once per week or more was higher among youth who agreed that energy drinks are safe drinks for teens (odds ratios [OR] = 7.7, 95 % confidence intervals [Cl] =3.6, 16.4) and among those who agreed that energy drinks are a type of sports drink (OR = 5.0, 95% C I= 2.4, 10.7). Conclusions. These findings suggest that many youth may be unaware or misinformed about the potential health effects and nutritional content of energy drinks. Efforts to improve education among youth about the potential adverse effects of consuming energy drinks are needed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Studies testing the effect of physician advice on alcohol consumption in a noncontrolled environment have not specifically focused on risky drinkers. Therefore, it is possible that the estimated effect of professional health advice primarily reflected moderate drinkers ’ responses. We assessed whether professional health advice reduced alcohol consumption among risky and binge drinkers in a real-world setting. Design. Retrospective cohort analysis. Setting. We used 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Annual Survey Data. Subjects. Five thousand seven hundred thirty-five adult male and nonpregnant female risky drinkers, with hypertension or borderline hypertension, who reported on whether they were advised to reduce alcohol consumption. Measures. Dependent variable: respondent was currently reducing alcohol use to control hypertension (1 = yes; 0 = no). Primary regressor: respondent claimed to have received advice from a health professional on reducing alcohol consumption to control hypertension (1 = yes; 0 = no). Analysis. The model was estimated using generalized maximum entropy. Results. Professional health advice increased the probability that both risky (marginal effect [ME] = .09), and binge drinkers (M E= .07) reduced their alcohol consumption. Conclusion. Our findings indicate that risky drinkers can effectively be targeted with consumption advice. This has important policy implications given that society bears the largest cost for this group, whereas moderate drinkers have been found to be relatively productive and healthy.

AB- Purpose. To examine the association between vision loss and cardiorespiratory fitness among young and middle-age U.S. adults. Design. The study had a cross-sectional design. Setting. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 served as the study setting. Subjects. Study subjects included 3135 adults ages 20 to 49 years. Measures. Cardiorespiratory fitness teas assessed from cardiorespiratory extrapolation using heart rate response during submaximal treadmill testing, with inadequate cardiorespiratory fitness defined as below the 60th percentile for age and gender. Visual acuity was objectively assessed for each eye. Analysis. Multivariable regession (linear and logistic) models were computed to examine the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and vision. Results. Poorer cardiorespiratory fitness ((β = --3.7 mL O2/kg per minute; 95 % confidence interval:--5.3 to--2.2) was observed in subjects with visual impairment after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and comorbid illness. Participants with vision impairment, as compared with those with normal sight, had 4.4-fold higher odds of having inadequate cardiorespiratory fitness (95% confidence interval: 1.04--18.97), whereas participants with uncorrected refractive error were not more likely to demonstrate poorer cardiorespiratory fitness. Conclusion. Adults with visual impairment, but not adults with uncorrected refractive error, demonstrate a significant reduction in cardiorespiratory fitness and are much more likely to have inadequate fitness compared with those with normal vision. Evaluation and implementation of strategies to increase cardiorespiratory fitness among those with vision impairment, in particular, are needed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of a structured after-school program housed in a large county parks system on participant health and wellness outcomes. Design. Longitudinal cohort study over one school year (fall 2011-spring 2012). Setting. A total of 23 county parks in Florida. Subjects. Children ages 5 to 16 (N = 349, 55 % non-Hispanic black, 40% Hispanic, mean age 8. 9 years). Intervention. An after-school program called Fit-2-Play that integrates daily standardized physical activity and health and wellness education components. Measures. Preintervention (August/September 2011) and postintervention (May/June 2012) anthropometric, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, fitness, and health and wellness knowledge measurements were collected. Analysis. Comparison of pre-post outcome measure means were assessed via general linear mixed models for normal-weight (body mass index [BMI] < 85 th percentile for age and sex) and overweight/obese (BMI ≥85th percentile for age and sex) participants. Results. The overweight/obese group significantly decreased their mean (1) BMI z score (2.0 to 1.8, p < .01) and (2) subscapular skinfold measurements (19.4 to 17.5 mm, p < .01) and increased (1) mean laps on the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run test (10.8 to 12.5, p = .04) and (2) percentage with normal systolic blood pressure (58.1 % to 71.0%, p = .03) from pretest to posttest. On average, participants significantly improved their health and wellness knowledge over the school year (p < .01). Normal-weight participants maintained healthy BMI ranges and significantly increased fitness levels. Conclusion. Findings suggest that the Fit-2-Play after-school programs can be a significant resource for combating childhood obesity and instilling positive physical health in children, particularly among ethnic and socioeconomically diverse communities.

AB- Purpose. To create and test an index to indicate both availability and quality of physical activity (PA) resources (PARs), to examine associations between access to quality PARs and changes in PA, and to determine whether this association differed in lower- and higher-income neighborhoods. Design. Longitudinal, 6-month intervention. Setting. Houston and Austin, Texas. Subjects. African-American and Hispanic or Latina women. Measures. Women (N = 410) completed a questionnaire and accelerometry to measure PA. Neighborhoods (N = 163) were classified as lower- or higher-income by median household income at the census-tract level. PARs were audited using the PARA (physical activity resource assessment). Access to quality PARs was determined by a composite index (QPAR) of features, amenities, and incivilities. Analysis. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to examine changes in PA by (1) neighborhood income (lower/higher) and QPAR (lower/higher) groups, and (2) neighborhood income (lower/higher) and number of PARs (lower/higher) groups, adjusting for ethnicity, household income, and body mass index. Results. Women in neighborhoods with lower QPAR scores had small increases in self-reported vigorous PA (M Δ = 327.8 metabolic equivalent of task [MET]-min/wk) and decreases in accelerometer PA (M = —3.4 min/d), compared to those with higher QPAR scores who had larger increases in self-reported vigorous PA (M Δ = 709.8 MET-min/wk) and increased accelerometer PA (M = 3 .9 min/d). There was a significant interaction between changes in leisure-time PA, QPAR score, and number of PARs (p= .049). Women with both more PARs and higher QPAR scores reported greater increases in leisure-time PA than women with fewer PARs and lower QPAR scores. Conclusion. Access to higher-quality PARs can help increase or maintain PA over time regardless of neighborhood income. PAR quality is a separate and distinct, important determinant of PA in ethnic minority women ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objectives. Loneliness is common among older persons and has been associated with health and mental health risks. This systematic review examines the utility of loneliness interventions among older persons. Data Source. Thirty-four intervention studies were used. Study Inclusion Criteria. The study was conducted between 1996 and 2011, included a sample of older adults, implemented an intervention affecting loneliness or identified a situation that directly affected loneliness, included in its outcome measures the effects of the intervention or situation on loneliness levels or on loneliness-related measures (e.g., social interaction), and included in its analysis pretest-posttest comparisons. Data Extraction. Studies were accessed using the databases PsycINFO, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, AgeLine, PsycBOOKS, and Google Scholar for the years 1996–2011. Data Synthesis. Interventions were classified based on population, format, and content and were evaluated for quality of design and efficacy. Results. Twelve studies were effective in reducing loneliness according to the review criteria, and 15 were evaluated as potentially effective. The findings suggest that it is possible to reduce loneliness by using educational interventions focused on social networks maintenance and enhancement. Conclusions. Multiple approaches show promise, although flawed design often prevents proper evaluation of efficacy. The value of specific therapy techniques in reducing loneliness is highlighted and warrants a wider investigation. Studies of special populations, such as the cognitively impaired, are also needed.

AB- Purpose. South Asian (SA) women in the United States report extremely low rates of leisure time physical activity (PA) compared with women in other ethnic minority groups. This study explored SA women’s perspectives on PA during different life stages. Design. This is a community-based participatory research study that used focus groups. Setting. The study setting was a community-based organization that provides social services to SA immigrants in Chicago, Illinois. Participants. The study team conducted six focus groups (in English and Hindi) with 42 SA women, ages 18 to 71 years. Method. A semistructured interview guide was used to foster discussion about perceptions of, barriers to/facilitators of, and suggestions for PA programs. Discussions were transcribed and independently coded by two reviewers using thematic content analysis and guided by a coding scheme that was developed a priori. Results. Participants said that different life stages strongly influenced their PA. PA decreased after marriage and having children. Chronic diseases constrained older women from more vigorous PA. Barriers to PA among younger women were family disapproval and perceptions that PA is unnecessary if you are ‘‘skinny.’’ Women agreed that PA is not a priority within the culture, and that interventions must take into account cultural, religious, and family context. Conclusion. Sociocultural norms, family constraints, and lack of awareness about the benefits of PA strongly influenced PA among SA women. Culturally salient intervention strategies might include programs in trusted community settings where women can exercise in women-only classes with their children, and targeted education campaigns to increase awareness about the benefits of PA across life stages.

AB- Purpose. To determine whether university women who demonstrated internal motivation related to eating behavior may also be internally motivated to participate in regular physical activity (PA) and have a lower body mass index (BMI) when controlling for age. Traditional approaches for health promotion related to healthy weight include restrictive eating and exercise prescription. Examining motivation for eating and PA may prove an effective alternative for achieving or maintaining healthy weight for university women. Design. Design was a cross-sectional study. Setting. Study setting was a large, public university in the western United States. Subjects. Study subjects were 200 undergraduate women with a mean age of 19 years, mostly white (90%) and of healthy weight (69%, with a BMI range of 18.5–24.9). Measures. Study measures were the Intuitive Eating Scale and the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire. Analysis. Correlations and regression models were used. Intuitive eating was examined in the sample as a whole and among subgroups of respondents grouped based on tertile rankings of intuitive eating scores. Results. There was evidence that women who demonstrated internal motivation related to eating were also internally motivated to participate in regular PA. Women who reported being internally motivated to eat were significantly more likely to engage in PA for pleasure and to view PA as part of their self-concept. Women who reported high levels of intuitive eating had significantly lower BMI scores than those reporting medium or low levels when controlling for age. Conclusion. For women to achieve or maintain a healthy weight, it may be best for health professionals to examine motivation for eating and PA rather than the encouragement of restrictive eating and exercise prescriptions.

When asked about what influenced him to write the book "Health Program Planning" in 1979, he refers to economists who are judging the cost-effectiveness of health promotion in the workplace. Green reflects on the economics of health education and on the correlation between community organizing influences and his immersion on psychology and individual behavior theories. He also discusses social barriers to health promotion.

AB- Purpose . To evaluate the pattern of perceived changes in the implementation of the Health Promoting Hospital (HPH) Initiative. Design . This was a cross-sectional study with a self-administered questionnaire, asking the correspondents what changes they perceived before and after adopting the HPH initiative. Setting . This study was conducted with 55 hospitals committed to the HPH in Taiwan, and 52 completed the questionnaire. Subjects . One coordinator in each of the 55 hospitals served as subject. Intervention . HPH seeks to improve health gains for its stakeholders by developing structure, cultures, decisions, and process conducive to health promotion. Measures . Perceived changes were measured in the areas of more resource inputs, changing work models, realigned implementation strategies, more programs, higher service volume, and improved quality control. Regarding realigned strategies, emphasizing the impact of healthy public policies, supportive environments, staff participation, individual knowledge and skills, and reorienting health services were measured. Analysis . Descriptive analysis was used to examine the pattern of "prevalence of changes." Results . Changes were more prevalent in the domains of patients and community (both with averaged ranks = 1.8); "realigning strategies" was the area in which more changes were perceived (average rank = 1). Emphases on healthy public policies and reorienting health services were the leading changes (both averaged ranks = 2.4) regarding realigning strategies. Conclusion . The HPH initiative appeared to be an effective approach to build organizational capacity for health promotion. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose . A criticism of incentives for health behaviors is that incentives undermine intrinsic motivation. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of monetary incentive provision on participation motives for exercise in first-year college students at a northeastern public university. Design . Randomized-controlled trial. Setting . Public university in the Northeastern United States. Subjects . One hundred seventeen first-year college students. Intervention . Participants were randomized to one of three conditions: a control condition receiving no incentives for meeting fitness-center attendance goals; a discontinued-incentive condition receiving weekly incentives during fall semester 2011, and no incentives during spring semester 2012; or a continued-incentive condition receiving weekly incentives during fall semester, and incentives on a variable-interval schedule during spring semester. Measures . The Exercise Motivation Inventory 2 measured exercise participation motives at baseline, end of fall semester, and end of spring semester. Fitness-center attendance was monitored by using ID-card check-in/check-out records. Analysis . Repeated-measures analyses using linear mixed models with first-order autoregressive covariance structures were run to compare motive changes in the three conditions. Results . Participation motives of Enjoyment and Revitalization associated with intrinsic motivation did not decrease significantly over time in any of the conditions, F(4, 218) = 2.25, p = .065 and F(4, 220) = 1.67, p = .16, respectively. Conclusion . Intrinsically associated participation motives for exercise did not decrease with incentive provision. Therefore, incentives may encourage fitness-center attendance without negatively impacting participation motives for exercise. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Questionnaires were collected 1 month before, 1 month after, and 6 months within a cluster randomized field experiment. Setting . Texas small businesses in construction, transportation, and service industries. Subjects . A total of 1510 employees from 45 businesses were randomly assigned to receive no training or one of the interventions. Intervention . The interventions were 4-hour on-the-job classroom trainings that encouraged healthy lifestyles and seeking professional help (e.g., from the Employee Assistance Program [EAP]). The Team Awareness Program focused on peer referral and team building. The Choices in Health Promotion Program delivered various health topics based on a needs assessment. Measures . Questionnaires measured help-seeking attitudes and behavior, frequency of drinking alcohol, and job-related incidents. Analysis . Mixed-model repeated-measures analyses of covariance were computed. Results . Relative to the control group, training was associated with significantly greater reductions in drinking frequency, willingness to seek help, and seeking help from the EAP. After including help-seeking attitudes as a covariate, the correlation between training and help seeking becomes nonsignificant. Help-seeking behavior was not correlated with drinking frequency. Conclusion . Training improved help-seeking attitudes and behaviors and decreased alcohol risks. The reductions in drinking alcohol were directly correlated with training and independent from help seeking. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose . To test the efficacy of a culturally targeted breast cancer screening educational program in increasing mammogram completion in Chinese-American immigrant women. Design . Randomized controlled study. Setting . Chinese communities, Portland, Oregon. Subjects . From April 2010 to September 2011, 300 women were randomized to receive a theory-based, culturally targeted breast cancer screening educational intervention (n = 147) or a mammography screening brochure published by the National Cancer Institute (n = 153). Intervention . The two-part intervention consisted of group teaching with targeted, theory-based messages followed by individual counseling sessions. Measures . Mammography completion, perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived cultural barriers, and demographic variables. Analysis . A 2 × 3 mixed logistic model was applied to determine odds ratio of mammogram completion. Results . Behavior changed in both groups, with a total of 170 participants (56.7%) reporting a mammogram at 12 months. The logistic model indicated increased odds of mammogram completion in the intervention compared to the control group at 3, 6, and 12 months. When controlling for marital status, age, and age moved to the United States, the intervention group was nine times more likely to complete mammograms than the control group. Conclusion . The culturally targeted educational program significantly increased mammogram use among Chinese immigrant women. Further testing of effectiveness in larger community settings is needed. The intervention may also serve as a foundation from which to develop education to increase cancer screening among other minority subgroups. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose . Low back pain is a leading cause of disability in firefighters and is related to poor muscular endurance. This study examined the impact of supervised worksite exercise on back and core muscular endurance in firefighters. Design . A cluster randomized controlled trial was used for this study. Setting . The study occurred in fire stations of a municipal fire department (Tampa, Florida). Subjects . Subjects were 96 full-duty career firefighters who were randomly assigned by fire station to exercise (n = 54) or control (n = 42) groups. Intervention . Exercise group participants completed a supervised exercise targeting the back and core muscles while on duty, two times per week for 24 weeks, in addition to their usual fitness regimen. Control group participants continued their usual fitness regimen. Measures . Back and core muscular endurance was assessed with the Biering-Sorensen test and plank test, respectively. Analysis . Changes in back and core muscular endurance from baseline to 24 weeks were compared between groups using analysis of covariance and linear mixed effects models. Results . After 24 weeks, the exercise group had 12% greater (p = .021) back muscular endurance and 21% greater (p = .0006) core muscular endurance than did the control group. The exercise intervention did not disrupt operations or job performance. Conclusion . A supervised worksite exercise program was safe and effective in improving back and core muscular endurance in firefighters, which could protect against future low back pain. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose . To determine the effect of two jumping programs on hip bone mineral density (BMD) in women. Design . Randomized controlled trial. Setting . Approximately 20 cities in the Mountain West. Subjects . Sixty premenopausal women, aged 25 to 50 years, completed the intervention. Intervention . Subjects were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two jumping groups. The Jump 10 group performed 10 jumps with 30 seconds rest between jumps, twice daily for 16 weeks, while the Jump 20 group performed the same protocol but with 20 jumps. Measures . Hip BMD was measured by using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Analysis . Analysis of variance and covariance. Results . At 8 weeks, unadjusted percentage change in hip BMD was significantly different among groups (F = 5.4, p = .0236). Specifically, compared with controls, the Jump 20 women had significantly greater gains in hip BMD and the Jump 10 women had marginally greater improvements. Following 16 weeks of jumping, differences between the Jump 10 and the Jump 20 groups compared with controls were significant (F = 4.2, p = .0444), especially after adjusting for the covariates (F = 7.3, p = .0092). Conclusion . After 16 weeks of high-impact jump training, hip BMD can be improved in premenopausal women by jumping 10 or 20 times, twice daily, with 30 seconds of rest between each jump, compared with controls.

AB- Purpose. To investigate the effectiveness of the Well at Dell comprehensive health management program in delivering health care and productivity cost savings relative to program investment (i.e., return on investment). Design. A quasi-experimental design was used to quantify the financial impact of the program and nonexperimental pre-post design to evaluate change in health risks. Setting. Ongoing worksite health management program implemented across multiple U.S. locations. Subjects. Subjects were 24,651 employees with continuous medical enrollment in 2010-2011 who were eligible for 2011 health management programming. Intervention. Incentive-driven, outcomes-based multicomponent corporate health management program including health risk appraisal (HRA)/wellness, lifestyle management, and disease management coaching programs. Measures. Medical, pharmacy, and short-term disability pre/post expenditure trends adjusted for demographics, health status, and baseline costs. Self-reported health risks from repeat HRA completers. Analysis. Propensity score-weighted and multivariate regression-adjusted comparison of baseline to post trends in health care expenditures and productivity costs for program participants and nonparticipants (i.e., difference in difference) relative to programmatic investment. Results. The Well at Dell program achieved an overall return on investment of 2.48 in 2011. Most of the savings were realized from the HRA/wellness component of the program. Cost savings were supported with high participation and significant health risk improvement. Conclusion. An incentive-driven, well-managed comprehensive corporate health management program can continue to achieve significant health improvement while promoting health care and productivity cost savings in an employee population.

AB- Purpose . To examine the relationship between perceived workplace health support and employee productivity. Design . A quantitative cross-sectional study. Setting . Washington State agencies. Subjects . A total of 3528 employees from six state agencies were included in this analysis. Measures . Perceived workplace health support was assessed by two questions that queried respondents on how often they felt supported by the workplace for healthy living and physical activity. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire was used to measure health-related absenteeism and presenteeism in the past 7 days. Analysis . Multivariate linear regression was used to estimate the mean differences in productivity by levels of perceived health support. Results . Most participants were between 45 and 64 years of age and were predominantly non-Hispanic white. Presenteeism varied significantly by the level of perceived workplace health support, with those who felt least supported having higher presenteeism than those who felt most supported. The difference in presenteeism by perceived workplace support remained significant in models adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics (mean difference: 7.1% for support for healthy living, 95% confidence interval: 3.7%, 10.4%; 4.3% for support for physical activity, 95% confidence interval: 1.7%, 6.8%). Absenteeism was not associated with perceived workplace health support. Conclusion . Higher perceived workplace health support is independently associated with higher work productivity. Employers may see productivity benefit from wellness programs through improved perceptions of workplace health support. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine if the sex of the child moderates the relationships between perceptions of the physical/social environments and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in youth. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. North Carolina. Subjects. A final sample of 711 children, 8 to 17 years of age, was available for analysis. Measures. Self-reported presence of environmental factors previously identified to be associated with physical activity in youth was collected via survey. Daily MVPA was assessed via accelerometry for a minimum of 4 days. Analysis. Multilevel linear regression models were employed, adjusted for clustering at the county and individual level. MVPA was first regressed onto sex and environmental perception items while controlling for grade and race. The interaction term between sex and environmental perception was then added to the model. Results. A significant positive association was observed in the first models between MVPA and two items related to parent permission to (1) walk and (2) ride a bike in the neighborhood. These effects were fully moderated by sex, with males indicating "yes" on these items exhibiting 6.87 and 5.21 more minutes of MVPA (respectively) than males indicating "no." Conclusion. Environmental perceptions appear to be related to MVPA, but this relationship is present only in males. Future research should be conducted to identify modifiable social and physical characteristics that are associated with MVPA in females. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To provide a snapshot of provider-based complementary and alternative medicine (pbCAM) use among adult smokers and assess the opportunity for these providers to deliver tobacco cessation interventions. Design. Cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2002 and 2007 National Health Interview Surveys. Setting. Nationally representative sample. Subjects. A total of 54,437 (31,044 from 2002; 23,393 from 2007) adults 18 years and older. Measures. The analysis focuses on 10 types of pbCAM, including acupuncture, Ayurveda, biofeedback, chelation therapy, chiropractic care, energy therapy, folk medicine, hypnosis, massage, and naturopathy. Analysis. The proportions of current smokers using any pbCAM as well as specific types of pbCAM in 2002 and 2007 are compared using SAS SURVEYLOGISTIC. Results. Between 2002 and 2007, the percentage of recent users of any pbCAM therapy increased from 12.5% to 15.4% (p = .001). The largest increases occurred in massage, chiropractic, and acupuncture. Despite a decrease in the national average of current smokers (22.0% to 19.4%; p = .001), proportions of smokers within specific pbCAM disciplines remained consistent. Conclusion. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners, particularly those in chiropractic, acupuncture, and massage, represent new cohorts in the health care community to promote tobacco cessation. There is an opportunity to provide brief tobacco intervention training to CAM practitioners and engage them in public health efforts to reduce the burden of tobacco use in the United States.

AB- Purpose. The study investigated the relationships among local smoke-free public policies, county-level quitline call rate, and adult smoking status. Design. A retrospective cross-sectional examination of demographic characteristics, smoking status of Kentuckians, and data from the Kentucky Tobacco Quitline were used to investigate the relationship of local smoke-free ordinances or Board of Health regulations together with county-level quitline use rates and population-level adult smoking status. Setting. One hundred and four Kentucky counties. Subjects. The sample was comprised of 14,184 Kentucky participants with complete demographic information collected from the 2009-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Measures. Individual-level demographics and smoking status from the BRFSS; county-level urban/rural status; quitline rates; and smoke-free policy status. Analysis. Given the hierarchical structure of the dataset, with BRFSS respondents nested within county, multilevel modeling was used to determine the predictors of smoking status. Results. For every 1-unit increase in the county-level call rate the likelihood of current smoking status decreased by 9%. Compared to those living in communities without a policy, those in communities with a smoke-free public policy were 18% less likely to be current smokers. Limitations include quitline call rate as the sole indicator of cessation demand, as well as the cross-sectional design. Conclusion. Communities with smoke-free policies and higher rates of quitline use have lower rates of adult smoking. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine perceptions of military personnel about tobacco use. Design. Secondary analysis of (1) focus group and (2) interview data. Setting. U.S. military. Subjects. Total participants (n = 241): Enlisted personnel, supervisors (n = 189 individuals participating in 23 focus groups), tobacco control managers, and policy leaders (n = 52 interview participants). Intervention. Not applicable. Measures. Not applicable. Analysis. Inductive, iterative coding for salient themes using an interpretive approach. Application of the concept of mediatory myths, used by institutions to cover over internal contradictions. Results. All types of participants endorsed the idea that tobacco was needed in the military for stress relief. Types of stress identified included fitting in, (relationships with coworkers and superiors) and control of workflow (taking breaks). Participants also discussed beliefs about the impact of tobacco on the military mission, and institutional sanction of tobacco use. Conclusion. Despite tobacco's well-documented negative effects on fitness, the myth that tobacco relieves stress serves several institutional functions in the military. It serves to minimize perceptions of stress on the fitness of personnel, suggests that stress can be managed solely by individuals, and institutionalizes tobacco use. Growing recognition among military leadership that countering stress is essential to fitness offers an opportunity to challenge this myth. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study explored the substance abuse and human immunodeficiency virus prevention needs of urban minority adolescents. Design. Six 1-hour focus groups. Setting. Two high schools and two community-based organizations located in the city of Paterson, New Jersey. Participants. The sample included 41 African-American and Latino youth, ranging in ages from 13 to 18 years. Method. Data were collected through six focus group interviews. Each group discussion was audiorecorded and transcribed. Qualitative software was then used to facilitate the processes o f thematic analysis, until emergent themes transcended the data. To bolster the rigor and confirmability of analysis, additional researchers coded stratified selections of transcript. Results. Study participants were able to identify the environmental threats and structural deficits impacting their city. Few of the youth were able to recognize substance abuse and HTV/AIDS prevention messages in their immediate surroundings. Additionally, most participants indicated that prevention messages must be delivered in authentic ways from relatable sources in order to resonate with their audience. Conclusion. Our findings emphasize the importance of infusing the adolescents ’ voices into the design and implementation of health promotion messages, which could serve to increase their receptivity and responsiveness, and the overall resonance o f the interventions.

AB- Purpose. To test the effects of a family-centered intervention for enhancing intentions to exercise among African-American boys with nonresident fathers. Design. Quasi-experimental, intervention study. Setting. Two Midwestern cities. Subjects. A total of 287 nonresident African-American fathers and their 8- to 12-year-old sons (n = 158 intervention dyads; n = 129 comparison dyads). Intervention. The Fathers and Sons Program is a 15-session family-based intervention focused on promoting the health of African-American boys by enhancing the parenting attitudes and behaviors of their nonresident fathers and positively influencing parent-child interactions. Measures. Demographic information and intervention outcomes were assessed at baseline and follow-up via self-report. Analysis. Descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and structural equation modeling. Results. The intervention was successful in improving the exercise intentions of boys (B = .246; p = .005; B = .210; p = .012). The effect was not direct; increasing contact between fathers and sons (B = .154; p = .001), enhancing the quality of their relationship (B = .366; p < .001), and improving fathers' own intentions to exercise (B = .265; p = .001) were mediating factors. Conclusion. Interventions aimed at improving exercise intentions among African-American boys with nonresident fathers should focus on relational factors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may cause not only inflammation in the lungs but also systemic effects. One potential strategy to reduce systemic inflammation and attenuate disease progression is physical activity (PA). However, no nationally representative studies, to our knowledge, have examined the association between objectively measured physical activity and inflammation among those with COPD. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006. Subjects. Two hundred thirty-eight former or current smokers with self-reported COPD who had complete data on study variables. Measures. Participants wore an accelerometer for ≥4 days to assess light-intensity PA (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), and total physical activity (TPA); completed questionnaires to assess self-reported COPD and smoking status; and had their blood taken to assess white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil levels. Analysis. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used. Results. LPA (β = -.0004), MVPA (β = -.04), and TPA (β = -.0004) were significantly inversely associated with WBC level. Similarly, LPA (β = -.001) and TPA (β = -.001) were significantly inversely associated with neutrophils; however, MVPA was marginally associated with neutrophils (β = -.05; p =.06). Conclusion. These analyses demonstrate an inverse association between objectively measured PA and inflammation among current or former smokers with COPD. If these findings are confirmed elsewhere, then PA among those with COPD may serve as an anti-inflammatory strategy to possibly decrease cardiovascular and metabolic disease occurrence.

AB- Abstract Objective. This systematic review synthesizes the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of population-level interventions to promote physical activity. Data Source . A systematic literature search was conducted between May and August 2013 in four databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Only primary and preventive interventions aimed at promoting and maintaining physical activity in wide population groups were included. An economic evaluation of both effectiveness and cost was required. Secondary interventions and interventions targeting selected population groups or focusing on single individuals were excluded. Data Extraction. Interventions were searched for in six different categories: (1) environment, (2) built environment, (3) sports clubs and enhanced access, (4) schools, (5) mass media and community-based, and (6) workplace. Data Synthesis. The systematic search yielded 2058 articles, of which 10 articles met the selection criteria. The costs of interventions were converted to costs per person per day in 2012 U.S. dollars. The physical activity results were calculated as metabolic equivalent of task hours (MET-hours, or MET-h) gained per person per day. Cost-effectiveness ratios were presented as dollars per MET-hours gained. The intervention scale and the budget impact of interventions were taken into account. Results. The most efficient interventions to increase physical activity were community rail-trails ($.006/MET-h), pedometers ($.014/MET-h), and school health education programs ($.056/MET-h). Conclusion. Improving opportunities for walking and biking seems to increase physical activity cost-effectively. However, it is necessary to be careful in generalizing the results because of the small number of studies. This review provides important information for decision makers. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the extent to which meat consumption influences risk of weight gain in women during a 20-month period. Additionally, to determine the extent to which demographic, lifestyle, and dietary factors influence the meat–weight gain association. Design. Prospective cohort. Setting. Two metropolitan areas of the Mountain West. Subjects. Two hundred thirty-seven middle-aged women. Measures. Diet was assessed by using 7-day weighed food records, and physical activity was measured by using accelerometers. Other potential confounders included age; initial body weight; energy intake; percentage of energy from fat, protein, and carbohydrate; dietary fiber intake per 1000 kcal; and time in the investigation. Two meat variables were studied: very lean meat (VLM) and other meat (Meat). Analysis. Multiple regression, partial correlation, and relative risk. Results. Each additional serving (1 ounce) of Meat consumed at baseline per 1000 kcal was associated with a 1.19-kg gain in weight over time (F = 7.3, p = .0073). Controlling for physical activity, fiber, and macronutrient intake, individually, strengthened the relationship. Servings of VLM per 1000 kcal were not predictive of weight change (F = .00, p = .9576). With all potential confounders controlled, the relative risk of gaining weight (≥5 pounds) for women with Low Meat intake was .36 (95% confidence interval = .17–.76) compared to women with High Meat intake. Conclusion. Consuming meats other than those in the VLM category is associated with increased risk of weight gain over time. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. The study sought to assess the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing (MI) interventions in reducing alcohol consumption among college students, as compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. It also sought to identify the potential moderators to MI intervention effects. Data Source. Database sources consulted included Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLE, PsycLIT, CINAHL, and MEDLINE. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Included studies were (1) underpinned by experimental, quasi-experimental, and nonexperimental designs; (2) studies in which participants were either college males only or females only or both; and (3) studies in which adaptations of MI were based on key MI principles. Excluded studies were (1) non-English language studies; (2) studies not published from 2000– 2012; (3) studies in which participants were not college students; (4) studies in which intervention was not delivered by face-to-face approach; and (5) studies that failed to embark on postintervention follow-ups. Data Extraction. A total of 115 abstracts were screened. These were narrowed down to 13 studies from which data for the study were extracted. Data Synthesis. Selected studies were underpinned by experimental, quasi-experimental, and nonexperimental designs. Owing to the heterogeneity in selected studies, a narrative synthesis was used. Results. MI interventions were found to be effective in reducing alcohol consumption among college students, when compared to alternative interventions or no intervention. Potential moderators of MI intervention effects were identified to include practitioner’s adherence to MI techniques and individual’s drinking motives. Conclusion. MI presents itself as a promising tool that can augment the many existing social-environmental strategies of health promotion. (Am J Health Promot 2014;29[1]:e32–e42.) ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Organizational health culture is a health-oriented core characteristic of the organization that is shared by all members. It is effective in regulating health-related behavior for employees and could therefore influence the effectiveness of health promotion efforts among organizations and employees. This study applied a multilevel analysis to verify the effects of organizational health culture on the organizational and individual effectiveness of health promotion. Design. At the organizational level, we investigated the effect of organizational health culture on the organizational effectiveness of health promotion. At the individual level, we adopted a cross-level analysis to determine if organizational health culture affects employee effectiveness through the mediating effect of employee health behavior. Setting. The study setting consisted of the workplaces of various enterprises. Subjects. We selected 54 enterprises in Taiwan and surveyed 20 full-time employees from each organization, for a total sample of 1011 employees. Measures. We developed the Organizational Health Culture Scale to measure employee perceptions and aggregated the individual data to formulate organization-level data. Organizational effectiveness of health promotion included four dimensions: planning effectiveness, production, outcome, and quality, which were measured by scale or objective indicators. The Health Promotion Lifestyle Scale was adopted for the measurement of health behavior. Employee effectiveness was measured subjectively in three dimensions: self-evaluated performance, altruism, and happiness. Analysis. Following the calculation of descriptive statistics, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to test the multilevel hypotheses. Results. Organizational health culture had a significant effect on the planning effectiveness (b¼.356, p , .05) and production (b ¼ .359, p , .05) of health promotion. In addition, results of cross-level moderating effect analysis by HLM demonstrated that the effects of organizational health culture on three dimensions of employee effectiveness were completely mediated by health behavior. Conclusion. The construct connections established in this multilevel model will help in the construction of health promotion theories. The findings remind business executives that organizational health culture and employee health behavior help improve employee effectiveness. (Am J Health Promot 2014;29[1]:e53– e63.)

AB- Purpose. To examine behavioral patterns and sociodemographic predictors of diet, inactivity, and tobacco use among a diverse sample of residents from low-income housing developments. Design. In this cross-sectional survey study, households and residents were randomly selected using multistage cluster sampling. Setting. The study was conducted in 20 low-income housing developments in the Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area. Subjects. Subjects were 828 residents who completed the survey (response rate= 49.3%). Forty-one percent of participants were Hispanic and 38% were non-Hispanic Black, Measures. Outcomes measured were diet, inactivity, and tobacco use. Predictors measured were age, race/ethnicity, gender, education, country in which the subject was born, language spoken, and financial hardship. Analysis. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association of three health behaviors with sociodemographic factors. Results. Age, gender, language spoken, and financial hardship showed significant relationships with all three behaviors. For example., those who reported less financial hardship (odds ratio [OR] = 1.75) were more likely to eat healthier. Residents who spoke no English, or at least one language in addition to English, were significantly more likely to report healthier eating (OR = 2.78 and 3.30, respectively) than those who spoke English only. Men were significantly more likely to report less healthy eating (OR = 0.65) than were women. Similar trends emerged for inactivity and tobacco use. Conclusion. Effective health promotion interventions in low-income housing developments that leverage protective factors while addressing risk factors have the potential to reduce income-related health disparities in these concentrated resource-deprived neighborhoods.

AB- Purpose. To determine whether a school-wide intervention program to reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D) affected student achievement, rates of disciplinary actions, and attendance rates. Design. The HEALTHY primary prevention trial was designed to evaluate a comprehensive school-based intervention to reduce factors for T2D, especially overweight and obesity. Students were followed up from beginning of sixth grade (Fall 2006) through end of eighth grade (Spring 2009). Setting. Forty-two middle schools at seven U. S. sites. Subjects. Schools were randomized in equal numbers at each site to intervention (21 schools, 2307 students) or control (21 schools, 2296 students). Intervention. An integrated school-wide program that focused on (1) foods and beverages, (2) physical education, (3) classroom-based behavior change and education, and (4) social marketing communication and promotional campaigns. Measures. Aggregate (grade- and school-wide) test performance (passing rate), attendance, and referrals for disciplinary actions. Analysis. Descriptive statistics and tests of intervention versus control using mixed linear models methods to adjust for the clustering of students within schools. Results. There were no differences between intervention and control schools in test performance for mathematics (p= .7835) or reading (p = .6387), attendance (p= .5819), or referrals for disciplinary action (p = .8671). Conclusion. The comprehensive HEALTHY intervention and associated research procedures did not negatively impact student achievement test scores, attendance, or referrals for disciplinary action.

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between sleep patterns and adiposity in young adult women. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. The study took place at two Mountain West region universities and surrounding communities. Subjects. Subjects were 330 young adult women (20.2 ± 1.5 years). Measures. Sleep and physical activity were monitored for 7 consecutive days and nights using actigraphy. Height and weight were measured directly. Adiposity was assessed using the BOD POD. Analysis. Regression analysis, between subjects analysis of variance, and structural equation modeling were used. Results. Bivariate regression analysis demonstrated that sleep efficiency was negatively related to adiposity and that the 7-day standard deviations of bedtime, wake time, and sleep duration were positively related to adiposity (p < .05). Controlling for objectively measured physical activity strengthened the relationship between sleep duration and adiposity by 84% but had a statistically negligible impact on all other relationships that were analyzed. However, multivariate structural equation modeling indicated that a model including sleep efficiency, sleep pattern inconsistency (latent variable consisting of the 7-day standard deviations of bedtime, wake time, and sleep duration), and physical activity was the best for predicting percent body fat. Conclusion. Inconsistent sleep patterns and poor sleep efficiency are related to adiposity. Consistent sleep patterns that include sufficient sleep may be important in modifying risk of excess body fat in young adult women. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Research demonstrates that nicotine dependence and depression are associated and that physical activity is effective in reducing depression symptoms. However, our understanding of the potential beneficial effects of physical activity on depression in current smokers is more limited. The purpose of this study was to examine whether physical activity moderates the association between nicotine dependence and depression in U.S. smokers. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006. Subjects. Four hundred forty-one current adult smokers. Measures. Participants wore an accelerometer for at least 4 days and completed questionnaires to assess nicotine dependence and depression. Analysis. Effect modification and statistical interaction models were used. Results. Both models were significant. With regard to the statistical interaction model, and after controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, comorbidity index, homocysteine, cotinine, total cholesterol, sedentary behavior, and vitamins C, D, and E, objectively measured physical activity moderated the association between nicotine dependence and depression (interaction variable: odds ratio= 3.43; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-11.51; p = .04). Conclusion. In this national sample, of current smokers, physical activity moderated the association between nicotine dependence and depression. These results suggest that those individuals with nicotine dependence and who are less physically active are more likely to be depressed than what would be expected on the basis of the individual effects of nicotine and physical inactivity separately.

AB- Purpose. Taxes are a critical tobacco control policy, yet little systematic research has determined how mass media represent tobacco taxes. This study aimed to characterize print media coverage of tobacco tax initiatives in South Carolina (SC). Design. Content analysis. Setting. The setting comprised 346 news articles from 2006 to 2010 in the four main SC newspapers. Subjects. N/A Measures. A coding scheme with good inter-rater reliability (α= .90-1.0) assessed article type (news vs. opinion), arguments, and the story tendency regarding whether it was in favor of the tax, against the tax, or neutral/mixed. Analysis. Chi-square tests and t-tests assessed hypotheses regarding the prevalence and number of different arguments and article tendencies across different time periods (i.e., legislature in session vs. not in session; successful vs. unsuccessful initiative) and article types. Results. Most articles were favorable toward the tax (59%), with favorable articles most likely to be found in opinion pieces than in news articles. Compared to unsuccessful tax initiative years (2006 to 2009), articles from the successful year (2010) were more likely to include pro-tax arguments about how the tax can raise state revenues (47% vs. 33%; p = .020) and pay for tobacco control programs (40% vs. 26%; p = .014). Unsuccessful years included a relatively higher percentage of stories about the lack of consensus regarding how the tax money should be spent (25% vs. 11 %; p = .014). Within articles, the mean number of arguments favorable toward the tax and the mean number of economic arguments were marginally higher in the successful year compared to the unsuccessful years. Conclusion. Study results suggest that advocates build consensus and communicate more clearly on how tobacco tax revenue streams should be spent. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Assessment of short-term practice of relaxation therapy on autonomic and cardiovascular functions in first-year medical students. Design. Case-control, interventional study. Setting. Medical college laboratory. Subjects. Sixty-seven medical students, divided into two groups: study group (n= 35) and control group (n = 32). Intervention. Study group subjects practiced relaxation therapy (shavasana with a soothing background music) daily 1 hour for 6 weeks. Control group did not practice relaxation techniques. Measures. Cardiovascular parameters and spectral indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded before and after the 6-week practice of relaxation therapy. Analysis. The data between the groups and the data before and after practice of relaxation techniques were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Student t-test. In the study group, prediction of low-frequency to high-frequency ratio (LF-HF) of HRV, the marker of sympathovagal balance, to blood pressure (BP) status was assessed by logistic regression. Results. In the study group, there was significant reduction in heart rate (p = .0001), systolic (p = . 0010) and diastolic (p = . 0021) pressure, and rate pressure product (p < . 0001), and improvement in HRV indices, following 6 weeks of relaxation therapy. As determined by regession model, prediction of LFHF to BP status was more significant (odds ratio, 2. 7; p= . 009) after practice of relaxation therapy. There was no significant alteration in these parameters in control subjects. Conclusion. Short-term practice of relaxation therapy can improve autonomic balance and promote cardiovascular health of medical students. Sympathovagal balance is directly linked to BP status in these individuals. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. We have a limited understanding of the objectively determined physical activity levels by weight control status (i.e., trying to lose weight, trying to maintain weight, and neither trying to lose or maintain weight) among U.S. adults with diabetes. Therefore, this study assessed the association between physical activity and weight control status among U.S. adults with diabetes. Design. Cross-sectional survey. Setting. The 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was used, which is representative of the U.S. population. Subjects. Subjects were 733 adults (≥ 20 years) with diabetes. Measures. Participants wore an accelerometer to assess physical activity, and questionnaires were used to assess weight control status and covariates. Analysis. Multivariate negative binomial regressions were used. Results. After adjustments, and compared to those not trying to lose or maintain their weight, women trying to lose weight engaged in 74% more physical activity (rate ratio = 1.74; 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.14 to 2.65). Although findings were not significant for men, men were more likely than women to meet physical activity recommendations. Conclusion. Diabetic women trying to lose weight engaged in more physical activity than did their female counterparts not trying to lose or maintain their weight. Although men were more active than women, no differences in activity estimates occurred across weight control status for men. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Time perspective, a psychological construct denoting subjective orientation to either present or future concerns, has been inconsistently associated with healthy behaviors in adults. We hypothesized that associations would be stronger in young adults, who are first developing independent attitudes, than in older adults. Design. Cross-sectional survey. Setting. The study was conducted in three cities in the Mid-Atlantic region. Subjects. Subjects were 790 patrons of barber and beauty shops. Measures. Measures used were the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory future, present-fatalistic, and present-hedonistic subscales and current smoking, days per week of recreational exercise, and height and weight, by self-report. Analysis. We tested if associations between time perspective and exercise, obesity, and current smoking differed by age group (18-24 years, 25-34 years, and 35 years and older) using analysis of variance and logistic regression. Results. Higher future time perspective scores, indicating greater focus on future events, was associated with more frequent exercise, whereas higher present-fatalistic time perspective scores, indicating more hopelessness, was associated with less frequent exercise in 18- to 24-year-olds, but not in older individuals. Lower future time perspective scores, and higher present-hedonistic time perspective scores, indicating interest in pleasure-seeking, were also associated with obesity only in 18- to 24-year-olds. Current smoking tuas not related to time perspective in any age group. Conclusion. Time perspective has age-specific associations with exercise and obesity, suggesting stages when time perspective may influence health behavior decision making. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of a program of moderate physical exercise throughout pregnancy on maternal and fetal parameters. Design. The study design was a randomized controlled trial. Setting. The study took place at the Hospital of Fuenlabrada in Madrid, Spain. Sample. Analyzed were 200 pregnant women (31.54 ± 3.86 years), all of whom had uncomplicated and singleton gestation. Of these subjects, 107 were allocated to the exercise group (EG) and 93 to the control group (CG). Intervention. Women from EG participated in a physical conditioning program throughout pregnancy, which included a total of 55- to 60-minute weekly sessions, 3 days per week. Measures. Pregnancy outcomes. Maternal: gestational age, weight gain, type of delivery, blood pressure during pregnancy, gestational diabetes (n/%). Fetal: birth weight, birth size, head circumference, Apgar score, pH of umbilical cord. Analysis. Student’s unpaired t-test and x2 test were used; p values of ≤ .05 indicated statistical significance. Cohen’s d was used to determine the effect size. Results. There were significantly more pregnant women in the CG who gained excessive weight during their pregnancies than in the EG group (CG: N = 31, 35.6% versus N = 22, 21.2%; x2 = 4.95; p=.02). The effect size was small (Phi value =16). Other pregnancy outcome showed no differences between groups. Conclusion. A regular and moderate physical exercise program throughout pregnancy is not a risk to maternal and fetal well-being, and it helps to control excessive weight gain. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. There is little scholarship on physical activity among children within outdoor spaces and work is needed to advance the design of these spaces from “best practices” towards evidence-based design. This project examined how playground feature density relates to children’s physical activity. Design. We used the System for Observing Play and Leisure Activity to observe children’s physical activity. Setting. We observed children during school recess on 24 school grounds in the Denver metropolitan area of Colorado, in spring of 2010 and 2011. Subjects. A total of 31,069 observations were made from an estimated 9900 children aged 5 to 12. These were aggregated and analyzed in 397 playground zones. Measures. We examined utilization, the number of children present in a particular activity zone during an observation, and the percentage of children engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity as they relate to the density of constructed features on school playgrounds. Analysis. Ordinary least-squares linear regression model assessed the relationship between playground feature density and the utilization and moderate to vigorous physical activity. Results. Significant positive associations were observed between, utilization and feature density among all children (β = .20; p < .001) and a statistically significant but small association was observed between moderate to vigorous physical activity and feature density for girls (β = .12; p = .013), but not for boys. Conclusion. This analysis contributes to evidence that design features of play spaces may influence children’s behavior within school grounds. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Characterize mobile technology ownership, use, and relationship to self-reported cancer prevention behaviors and health status in a diverse, low-income sample of callers to 2-1-1. Design. Secondary analyses of cross-sectional survey data from a larger trial collected from June 2010 to December 2012. Setting. United Way Missouri 2-1-1 serves 99 of 114 counties and received 166,000 calls in 2011. Subjects. The respondents (baseline, n = 1898; 4 month, n = 1242) were predominantly female, non-Hispanic Black, younger than 50 years, with high-school education or less and annual income <$20,000. Measures. Cell phone ownership and use and its relationship to cancer prevention services and health status were assessed via telephone-based survey, using items adapted from previous research and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Smartphone ownership and use were also assessed. Analysis. Descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariate associations between cell phone ownership and prevention and health status are reported. Results. Three-fourths (74%) of study participants owned a cell phone and 23% owned a smartphone. Text messaging was the most popular use. Ownership was significantly associated with good to excellent health status and presence of smoke-free home policies in multivariate models. Conclusion. Cell phone ownership is growing and has potential to deliver health information to low-income populations. With 16 million calls annually, the national 2-1-1 system may be a promising model and platform. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study examined associations between employment characteristics and obesity among a sample representing civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. adults. Design. Quantitative, cross-sectional study. Setting. Workplace. Subjects. The 2010 National Health Interview Survey data for 15,121 employed adults (>18 years). Measures. The outcome variable was weight status, and exposure variables were employment characteristics (number o f employees, work hours, paid by the hour, paid sick leave, and health insurance offered). Analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for employment characteristics associated with obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m2) after controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, family income, fruit/vegetable intake, physical activity, smoking, and occupations. Results. Nationwide, 28% of employed adults were obese. From multivariate logistic regression, the odds of being obese was significantly greater among adults who worked at a company with 100 to 499 employees (OR= 1.19, 95% CI= 1.02-1.39) vs. with 1 to 24 employees and those who worked > 50 hours/week (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.05-1.65) vs. < 30 hours/week. Conclusion. Approximately 3 out of 10 employees were obese and 6 out of 10 were overweight or obese. A better understanding of why these employment characteristics are associated with obesity could help employers better develop and target interventions for obesity prevention and treatment in the worksites.

AB- Purpose. To examine the efficacy of a novel intervention for problematic eating behaviors and body dissatisfaction. Design. Participants enrolled in the intervention or waitlist comparison group were assessed at pre and post 10 weeks. Setting. Midwestern university. Subjects. One hundred twenty-four female employees or partners/spouses. Intervention. Eat for Life is a 10-week group intervention integrating mindfulness and intuitive eating skills. Measures. Self-report questionnaires included the Intuitive Eating Scale, Body Appreciation Scale, Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Questionnaire for Eating Disorder Diagnoses, and an author-constructed supplemental and demographic questionnaire. Analysis. Analyses of covariance and ordinal regression measured group differences. Structural equation modeling examined mediation effects. Results. Significant differences between groups were observed for body appreciation (F1,121 = 40.17, p= .000, partial eta squared= .25), intuitive eating (F1,121 = 67.44, p = .000, partial eta squared= .36), and mindfulness (F1,121 = 30.50, p = .000, partial eta squared= .20), with mean scores significantly higher in the intervention group than waitlist comparison group after 10 weeks. The intervention group was 3.65 times more likely to be asymptomatic for disordered eating than the comparison group. Mindfulness served as a partial mediator. Conclusion. The study provides support for an intervention combining intuitive eating and mindfulness for treatment of problematic eating behaviors and body dissatisfaction, with limitations including self-selection and lack of active control group.

AB- Purpose. To evaluate the interactions of risk factors and identify their most powerful discrimination pathway for the occurrence of low back pain (LBP). Design. A cross-sectional study. Setting. Taiwan. Subjects. Taiwanese population of 30 to 64 years old. Measures. A self-reported question, “Have you experienced LBP within the last 3 months" was used to evaluate LBP. The study variables included demographics (age, gender, occupation, education level, marital status, and household income), biometric health measures (bone mineral density and body mass index), dietary habits (weekly milk, coffee, tea, and soybean consumption), and other lifestyle factors (smoking habits, alcohol consumption, betel nut chewing, body weight control, exercise regularity, and stress management). Analysis. Logistic regression and classification tree analyses. Results. A total of 969 Taiwanese participants were analyzed. Primary logistic regression analysis identified three critical risk factors (gender, bone mineral density, and exercise regularity) for the occurrence of LBP. By classification tree analysis, demographic factors, dietary habits, and lifestyle factors had modifying effects on LBP. Conclusions. Various factors contribute to the risk of LBP. Interactions between risk factors should be considered when developing future strategies for the prevention and management of LBP. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The financial impact o f intensive medical interventions for weight loss has not been fully studied. Design. A randomized pragmatic clinical trial. Setting. Seven primary care clinics and one research center in Louisiana. Subjects. Severely obese individuals (body mass index 40-60 kg/m2) randomized to usual care (n = 190) or intensive medical management (n = 200). Forty-seven percent of participants completed year 2 follow-up and were included in the analyses. Intervention. Physician-monitored intervention with recommendations for 12 weeks of liquid diet followed by 4 months of group behavioral therapy, structured diet, and option of pharmacotherapy, and an additional 16 months of maintenance strategies. Measures. Two-year preintervention and 5-year postintervention measures were computed from claims data and included (1) medical costs excluding pharmacy, (2) pharmacy costs only, (3) total medical and pharmacy costs, and (4) medical and pharmacy subcategory costs. Analysis. Differential categories for preintervention and postintervention were created using total sample 75th percentiles. Chi-square tests were employed to compare the intervention groups both preintervention and postintervention with respect to the proportion o f subjects above the 75th percentile for each of the cost categories. Results. Medical costs excluding pharmacy did not differ between groups. The intensive medical intervention group had a significantly smaller percentage of subjects above the 75th percentile for pharmacy costs only (p = .0125), and for antidiabetic agents (p = .0464), antihypertensives (p = .0075), and dyslipidemic subcategories (p = .0197). Conclusion. An intensive medical intervention may reduce pharmaceutical expenditures in severely obese individuals. These results must be viewed with caution given the high attrition o f study participants. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. To determine the relationship between return on investment (ROI) and quality of study methodology in workplace health promotion programs. Data Source. Data were obtained through a systematic literature search of National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Database o f Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Database (HTA), Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry, EconLit, PubMed, Embase, Wiley, and Scopus. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Included were articles written in English or German reporting cost(s) and benefit(s) and single or multicomponent health promotion programs on working adults. Retum-to-work and workplace injury prevention studies were excluded. Data Extraction. Methodological quality was graded using British Medical Journal Economic Evaluation Working Party checklist. Economic outcomes were presented as ROI. Data Synthesis. ROI was calculated as ROI= (benefits - costs of program)/costs o f program. Results were weighted by study size and combined using meta-analysis techniques. Sensitivity analysis was performed using two additional methodological quality checklists. The influences o f quality score and important study characteristics on ROI were explored. Results. Fifty-one studies (61 intervention arms) published between, 1984 and 2012 included 261,901 participants and 122,242 controls from nine industry types across 12 countries. Methodological quality scores were highly correlated between checklists (r= .84-.93). Methodological quality improved over time. Overall weighted ROI [mean ± standard deviation (confidence interval)] was 1.38 ± 1.97 (1.38-1.39), which indicated a 138% return on investment. When accounting for methodological quality, an inverse relationship to ROI teas found. High-quality studies (n = 18) had a smaller mean ROI, 0.26 ± 1.74 (.2 3 -.3 0 ), compared to moderate (n = 16) 0.90 ± 1.25 (.90-.91) and low-quality (n = 27) 2.32 ± 2.14 (2.30-2.33) studies. Randomized control trials (RCTs) (n = 12) exhibited negative ROI, -0.22 ± 2.41(-.2 7 to -.16). Financial returns become increasingly positive across quasi-experimental, nonexperimental, and modeled studies: 1.12 ± 2.16 (1.11-1.14), 1.61 ± 0.91 (1.56-1.65), and 2.05 ± 0.88 (2.04-2.06), respectively. Conclusion. Overall, mean weighted ROI in workplace health promotion demonstrated a positive ROI. Higher methodological quality studies provided evidence of smaller financial returns. Methodological quality and study design are important determinants. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. We investigated the relationship of the local availability of fast-food restaurant locations with diet and obesity. Design. We geocoded addresses of survey respondents and fast-food restaurant locations to assess the association between the local concentration of fast-food outlets, BMI, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Setting. The survey was conducted in Genesee County, Michigan. Subjects. There were 1345 individuals included in this analysis, and the response rate was 25%. Measures. The Speak to Your Health! Community Survey included fruit and vegetable consumption items from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, height, weight, and demographics. We used ArcGIS to map fast-food outlets and survey respondents. Analysis. Stepwise linear regressions identified unique predictors of body mass index (BMI) and fruit and vegetable consumption. Results. Survey respondents had 8 ± 7 fast-food outlets within 2 mfood habits -- resiles of their home. Individuals living in close proximity to fast-food restaurants had higher BMIs t(1342)= 3.21, p < .001, and lower fruit and vegetable consumption, t(1342)= 2.67, p= .008. Conclusion. Individuals may be at greater risk for adverse consequences of poor nutrition because of the patterns in local food availability, which may constrain the success of nutrition promotion efforts. Efforts to decrease the local availability of unhealthy foods as well as programs to help consumers identify strategies for obtaining healthy meals at fast-food outlets may improve health outcomes.

AB- Purpose. We assessed the effectiveness of a worksite management intervention (the 3W program) for overweight and obese hotel employees. Design. The program was tested in a 2-year duster-randomized trial involving 30 hotels that employed nearly 12,000 individuals. Setting. All participating hotels were on Oahu, Hawaii. The intervention was implemented within hotel worksites. Subjects. Participants were included in the analysis if they had an initial body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25, were assessed at least twice, were not missing other data needed for the analysis, and did not switch to employment at a hotel in a different experimental condition. Of the 6519 employees we assessed, data from 1207 individuals (intervention: 598; control: 610) met these criteria and contributed to the analysis. Intervention. The intervention had two components: (1) group meetings and (2) a workplace environment intervention. Measures. Weight and waist to height ratio (WHtR) were measured at three annual assessments. Analysis. The effect of the intervention on change in BMI and WHtR was estimated in hierarchical mixed regression models using full maximum likelihood to estimate model parameters. Results. The effects on change in BMI and WHtR were in the expected direction but were not statistically significant. Conclusion. The 3W program was not effective. The low intensity of the intervention may have contributed to its ineffectiveness. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Public policies that reduce the availability of alcohol in communities can reduce consumption and related harms. In this article, we propose a practical model to guide alcohol policy implementation. Approach. The conceptual model is informed by a case study of three U.S. cities that adopted restrictions on high-alcohol malt liquor sales. Setting. The three cities included Seattle, Washington; Santa Ana, California; and Washington, D.C. Participants. Participants (n = 39) represented neighborhood groups, city officials, local police, Alcohol Beverage Control (board members and enforcement personnel), alcohol retailers, alcohol industry representatives, and advocacy and service organizations. Method. We conducted key informant interviews with participants in each city. We coded and analyzed the data by using a grounded theory approach. Findings were used to identify and illustrate model components. Results. Implementation components include building public awareness and educating stakeholders, monitoring and enforcing compliance, evaluating process and outcomes, and institutionalizing the policy. The experiences of study cities illustrate the importance of these activities in maintaining policy effectiveness; for example, a lack of enforcement resources appeared to contribute to the erosion of compliance over time. Conclusion. The model addresses an important gap in alcohol policy research. It is intended to spur further research on the subject, provide a guide for policy practitioners, and ultimately improve the long-term effectiveness of alcohol control policies. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine the relationship between interactive media use (Internet and video games) and overweight risk in young adults. Design. Prospective cohort study. Setting. France (TEMPO study). Subjects. Community sample of 674 young adults aged 22 to 35 in 2009 (response rate to the original mail out: 44.3%). Measures. Data were collected through mail-based questionnaires from study participants in 1999 (juvenile overweight, juvenile TV use) and 2009 (overweight, Internet and video game use, regular physical activity), and from their parents who participated in the GAZEL study from 1989 to 2009 (parental overweight). Analysis. Logistic regression. Results. Participants who engaged in regular video game use (> 1 time/wk) were more likely to be overweight than those who did not (odds ratio [OR] 2.20, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.42-3.42). Adjusting for sex, regular athletic activity, juvenile overweight, juvenile TV use, and parental overweight, the OR associated with video game use decreased but remained statistically significant (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15-3.28). We found no significant association between Internet use and overweight. Conclusion. Video game use may be a relevant target for interventions aiming to decrease the burden of overweight and associated consequences in young adults. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

KW- Tobacco smoke exposure
AB- Purpose. To investigate whether a biomarker screening approach for tobacco smoke exposure (TSE) conducted concurrently with lead screening at well-child visits would increase parental smoking cessation and implementation of home smoking restrictions. Design. Observational, quasi-experimental. Setting. Pediatric clinic in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Subjects. Eighty parents who smoked and their children presenting for well-child visits. Intervention. Children in the intervention group had serum cotinine measured with lead screening. Laboratory results were sent to providers and parents and a counselor proactively contacted parents to offer an eight-session telephone intervention to help parents stop smoking. The comparison group, a historical control, received usual care. Measures. Parental smoking, engagement in tobacco treatment, and home and car smoking policies 8 weeks later. Analysis. Mean/standard deviation for continuous data or frequency/percentage for categorical data. Results. Eighty-four percent of eligible parents agreed to have their child tested for TSE along with lead testing. Measurable cotinine was identified in 93% of children. More parents in the intervention group received tobacco treatment than in the comparison group (74% vs. 0%) and more parents reported 7-day point-prevalent abstinence from smoking at 8 weeks (29% vs. 3%). Conclusion. These data demonstrate the feasibility of adding cotinine measurement to routine well-child lead screening to document TSE in small children. Data suggest providing this information to parents increases engagement in tobacco treatment and prompts smoking cessation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine the factorial validity and measurement invariance of scales that measure smoking-related self-efficacy, beliefs, and intention between daily and intermittent adolescent smokers. Design. Cross-sectional survey design. Setting. Selected high schools in eastern Texas. Subjects. Subjects luere 2888 high school current smokers; mean age 16.2 years; 53.5% male; 67.4% White, 17.8% Hispanic, 6.2% Black, 8.6% "other" Daily smokers comprised 37.9% of the sample (i.e., smoked at least one cigarette every day 30 days prior to the survey). Measures. Smoking-related self-efficacy and intention were measured by three items; beliefs were measured by four items. Analysis. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to test the invariance of the measures between daily and intermittent smokers. Fit indices included comparative fit index (CFI), nonnormed fix index (NNFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). Results. The three-factor measurement model had good fit for daily (CFI= . 97, NNFI= . 95, RMSEA = . 09) and intermittent (CFI= . 96, NNFI= . 95, RMSEA = . 09) smokers. Evidence of strong factorial invariance was found for the factors between the smoking subgroups (CFI= .96, NNFI= .96, RMSEA = .08). Conclusion. These measures may be used to capture and compare scores on self-efficacy to resist smoking, beliefs about benefits of smoking, and intention to smoke between daily and intermittent adolescent smokers.

AB- Purpose. To determine the physiological and psychological effects of adding a Himalayan singing bowl (HSB) to a directed relaxation (DR) session. Design. Randomized crossover study. Setting. Community-based counseling practice. Subjects. Fifty-one participants completed two randomly assigned sessions beginning with either 12 minutes of HSB or silence, followed by a 20-minute DR session. Intervention. Random order of HSB intervention/silence prior to DR. Measures. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scores measured before and after both sessions. Analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared differences between variables over time between both study days, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analyzed changes from baseline, controlling for baseline, age, and sex. Results. Fifty-one participants completed both sessions. There was a greater decline in systolic BP (p= . 044) and HR(p= . 003) with HSB compared to silence prior to DR Changes in diastolic BP were greater with HSB, with a nonsignificant trend (p= .073). Hypertensive subjects (n = 20) had similar and significant BP changes with HSB and silence when compared to normotensive subjects (n = 31). PANAS scores fell significantly with both interventions. Conclusions. BP and HR responses were enhanced by HSB exposure. HSB may be used as an adjunct to DR to produce physiological and psychological responses prior to DR. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine associations between academic performance and moderate-vigorous physical activity, strength training, fruit and vegetable intake, and sleep. Design. Cross-sectional observational study. Setting. Forty U.S. colleges and universities participating in the Fall 2008 National College Health Assessment-II (NHA-II) (median response, 27%). Subjects. A total of 16,095 undergraduate students (18-24 years; 70.3% female). Measures. Self-reported lifestyle variables from the NCHA-II questions were dichotomized as meeting or not meeting public health recommendations. Grad average ranged from 1.00 to 4.00 points. Analysis. Linear regression, adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related variables. Results. The prevalence of meeting public health recommendations was as follows: moderate-vigorous physical activity, 41.9%; strength training, 32.4%; fruit and vegetable intake, 4.6%; and sleep, 23.6 %. Grade average was higher in students meeting moderate-vigorous physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and sleep recommendations (p ≤ .019). If moderate-vigorous physical activity was met, grade average was higher by .03 points, .15 points higher when meeting fruit and vegetable intake recommendations, and .06 points higher for sleep. There was no significant change in grade average in those meeting strength-training recommendations. Conclusion. College students who adhere to public health recommendations for lifestyle behaviors have modestly higher grade averages after adjusting for sociodemographic and negative health behaviors.

AB- Purpose. No prospective studies have examined the association of poor social support and development of posltraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with chronic illness. This study addresses this knowledge gap. Design. This prospective study examines the relationship of social support to the subsequent development of PTSD during a 5-year period. Setting. San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Subjects. A total of 579participants with cardiovascular disease did not have PTSD at baseline and returned for the 5-year follow-up examination. Measures. PTSD measured by Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-TV. Social support measured by Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL). Analysis. Unconditional ordered logistic regression analyses were, performed to yield the odds ratio of developing PTSD for a one-standard-deviation change in ISEL score. Results. Of 579 participants who did not have PTSD at baseline, approximately 6.4% (n = 37) developed PTSD. Higher baseline perceived social support was strongly protective against development of PTSD (OR = .60, p = .001). Results remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, race, income, and depression (OR = . 69, p = . 04). Of social support types examined, the "tangible" and "belonging" domains were most strongly associated with future PTSD status. Conclusion. Social support may impact development of PTSD. Interventions that optimize social support may be part of a PTSD prevention program designed to help individuals at risk of developing PTSD. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To explore/identify patient perspectives regarding seeking, delaying, and avoiding health care services, particularly barriers and facilitators. Design. Face-to-face interviews with health plan survey respondents. Setting. An integrated health plan providing comprehensive care to 480,000 people in Oregon and Washington. Participants. Willing respondents randomly selected to maximize heterogeneity within the following strata: gender, health care utilization, and self reported alcohol consumption (indicator of health practices). Participants were 75 men and 75 women (150 total), 21 to 64 years old, with ≥12 months of health plan membership. Method. Participants were recruited by letter (52.5% agreed). Data collection stopped when planned interviews were completed; saturation (the point at which additional interviews were not producing novel information) was achieved for key study questions. Semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded. Reviews of codes related to care seeking and feelings/attitudes about providers produced common themes. Results. Facilitators of care seeking included welcoming staff, collaborative relationships with providers, and education about the value of preventive care. Barriers included costs, time needed for appointments, and cumbersome processes. Some participants delayed procedures, some avoided care until absolutely necessary, others framed care as routinely necessary. Conclusion. Increasing comfort, improving appointment and visit-related processes, having positive patient-physician relationships, and enhancing communication and clinician- provided education may facilitate appropriate use of preventive services. Further research is needed with larger, representative samples to evaluate findings. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To estimate the employer costs associated with employee obesity. Design. The study used cross-sectional analysis of employee health-risk assessment, disability, workers ' compensation, and medical claims data from 2006 to 2008. Setting. The study look place in the United States from 2006 to 2008. Subjects. A panel database with 29,699 employees drawn from a panel of employers and observed for 3 years each (N= 89,097) was used. Measures. Workdays lost owing to illness and disability; the cost of medical, short-term disability, and workers ' compensation claims; and employees ' adjusted body mass indices (BMI) were measured. Analysis. We. model the number and probability of workdays lost from illness, short-term disability, and workers ' compensation events; short-term disability and workers ' compensation payments; and health care spending as a function of BMI. We estimate spline regression models and fit results using a third-degree fractional polynomial. Results. Probability of disability, workers' compensation claims, and number of days missed owing to any cause increase with BMI above 25, as do total employer costs. The probability of a short-term disability claim increases faster for employees with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes. Normal weight employees cost on average $3830 per year in covered medical, sick day, short-term disability, and workers ' compensation claims combined; morbidly obese employees cost more than twice that amount, or $8067, in 2011 dollars. Conclusion. Obesity is associated with large employer costs from direct health care and insurance claims and indirect costs from lost productivity owing to workdays lost because of illness and disability.

AB- Purpose. To describe effective retention strategies in a clinical trial with a high risk, low-income, and vulnerable patient population with serious mental illness. Design. Follow-up assessments were conducted for a randomized clinical tobacco treatment trial at 3, 6, and 12 months postbaseline. Initial follow-up rates of <40% at 3 months led to implementation of proactive retention strategies including obtaining extensive contact information; building relationships with case managers and social workers; contacting jails and prisons; text messaging, e-mailing, and messaging via social networking sites; identifying appointments via electronic medical record; and field outreach to treatment facilities, residences, and parks. Setting. Large urban public hospital. Subjects. Participants were current smokers recruited from 100% smoke-free locked psychiatry units. Measures. Assessments covered demographics, substance use, and mental health functioning. Analysis. Retention rates were plotted over time in relation to key retention strategies. Chi-square and t- tests were used to examine participant predictors of retention at each follow-up. At the 12-month follow-up, the retention strategies that most frequently led to assessment completion were identified. Results. The sample (N= 100) was 65 % male; age x = 39.5 years (SD = 11.3); 44 % non-Hispanic white; 46% on Medicaid and 34% uninsured; 79% unemployed; and 48% unstably housed. Proactive retention strategies dramatically increased follow-up rates, concluding at 3 months= 82.65%, 6 months = 89.69%, and 12 months = 92.78%. Married and divorced/separated/widowed participants, those with higher income, and participants with alcohol or illicit drug problems had increased retention from 3- to 12- month follow-up. Conclusion. Follow-up rates improved as proactive methods lo contad participants were implemented. Dedicated research staff, multiple methods, community networking, and outreach within drug treatment settings improved retention. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. Examine the effect of interventions with parents and children on children's physical activity and body mass index (BMI). Data Source. Computerized searches for intervention studies published between 1990 and 2011 used multiple ProQuest databases, including unpublished dissertations and theses to minimize publication bias. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. English-language, intervention-testing studies of children, parents, or families with outcomes of physical activity or BMI were retrieved from peer- reviewed journals, dissertations, and theses. Eliminated studies had no control or comparison group; had no continuous outcome variable; had no physical activity/exercise and/or BMI as outcomes; or had incomplete statistics necessary for meta-analysis (means, standard deviations, or confidence intervals). Data Extraction. Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. Quality criteria were control group, objective outcome variable measure, clarity of variable definitions, and number and reason for subject withdrawal. Data Synthesis. Meta-analysis on the raw difference of means estimated mean weighted effect size (MWES) assessed dispersion of effects and computed a summary effect. Results. MWES for interventions with parents and children on physical activity (Z= 2.92; confidence interval [CI] = .09 to .48; p= .002) and on BMI for interventions with children alone (Z=-2.10; CI =-.16 to-.01; p= .02) was significant. Conclusion. A significant effect on physical activity but not on BMI was found when interventions included both parents and their children. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine test market awareness and promotional effects of Camel dissolvable tobacco. Design. Cross-sectional survey. Setting. Indiana test market. Subjects. Stratified sample of Indiana adults (N= 472). Measures. Data were poststratified and weighted to account for the sampling and demographics. Analysis. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis. Results. The study results indicate that 31.2% of participants were aware of Camel Dissolvables, 4.5% had tried them, and 8.3% were likely to try them. Tobacco use was a significant predictor of all outcomes; dual (cigarettes and smokeless tobacco) users were more likely to be familiar with, try, and be interested in trying Camel Dissolvables than single tobacco users and nonusers (p < . 05). Male gender was a significant predictor only for likelihood of trial (p < . 05). Education was a significant predictor only of actual trial (p < . 05). Familiarity was predicted by in-store, magazine, and mail promotions. Trial was predicted by having seen magazine ads. Web site exposure predicted likelihood of trial. Of those who reported trying Camel Dissolvables (N= 37), 49% no longer used them, 43% used them some days, and 8% used them daily. Continued use was reported by 87% of dual users and 26% of single tobacco users (p < .01). Conclusion. Smokers and male dual tobacco users appear most affected by Camel Dissolvables promotions.

AB- Purpose. Examine effects of exposure to two types of cessation advertisements on changes in cessation-related outcomes. Design. Experimental data from a nationally representative, longitudinal sample of smokers, collected in three waves over 4 weeks. Setting. National. Subjects. Three thousand and two adult U.S. smokers aged 18+ completed baseline and follow-up interviews at 2 and 4 weeks, from December 2010 to February 2011. Intervention. Six randomly assigned conditions consisting of repealed exposure to cessation advertisements: why-to-quit advertisements featuring emotional, personal testimonies (1: WTQ- T) or graphic images (2: WTQ-G); how-to-quit advertisements (3: HTQ), a combination of both (4: WTQ-T+ HTQ: 5: WTQ-G+ HTQ), and no-ad condition (6: control). Measures. Cessation-related beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and quitting behavior. Analysis. Multivariable ordinary least squares and logistic regressions testing whether exposure to antitobacco television advertisements were associated with changes in tobacco- related outcomes. Results. Exposure to WTQ-T or WTQ-G advertisements, both alone and combined with HTQ advertisements, elicited positive change in beliefs, attitudes, and intentions as compared to controls. Smokers in three of four WTQ conditions were substantially more likely to have quit smoking at 4 weeks than controls (odds ratios range from 5.9 to 10.1, p < .05 or better). No effects were found for the HTQ-only condition. Conclusion. Exposure to WTQ advertisements markedly increases the odds that a smoker will quit in the study period, suggesting positive movement toward successful, long-term cessation. HTQ advertisements did not enhance advertising effectiveness and may not be suitable as a primary message strategy. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine how religious congregations engage in social entrepreneurship as they strive to meet health-related needs in their communities. Design. Multiple case studies. Setting. Los Angeles County, California. Participants. Purposive sample of 14 congregations representing diverse races/ethnicities (African-American, Latino, and white) and faith traditions (Jewish and various Christian). Method. Congregations were recruited based on screening data and consultation of a community advisory board. In each congregation, researchers conducted interviews with clergy and lay leaders (n = 57); administered a congregational questionnaire; observed health activities, worship services, and neighborhood context; and reviewed archival information. Interviews were analyzed by using a qualitative, code-based approach. Results. Congregations' health-related activities tended to be episodic, small in scale, and local in scope. Trust and social capital played important roles in congregations' health initiatives, providing a safe, confidential environment and leveraging resources from-and for-faith-based and secular organizations in their community networks. Congregations also served as "incubators" for members to engage in social entrepreneurship. Conclusion. Although the small scale of congregations ' health initiatives suggest they may not have the capacity to provide the main infrastructure for service provision, congregations can complement the efforts of health and social providers with their unique strengths. Specifically, congregations are distinctive in their ability to identify unmet local needs, and congregations' position in their communities permit them to network in productive ways.

AB- Purpose. To develop a risk-scoring tool to identify in a base year patients likely to have high medical spending in the subsequent year and to understand the role obesity and obesity reduction may play in mitigating this risk. Design. Cross-sectional analysis, using commercial claims and health risk assessment data. Setting. United Stales, 2004-2009. Subjects. Panel of 192, 750 person-year observations from 116,868 unique working-age employees of large companies. Measures. Probability of high medical expenses (80th percentile or above) in the following year; adjusted body mass index (BMI). Analysis. Generate risk scores by modeling the likelihood of high next-year expenses as a function of base-year age, sex, medical utilization, comorbidities, and BMI. Estimate the effect of simulated bariatric intervention on patient risk scores. Results. Individuals with higher BMI were more likely to be categorized in the very high risk group, in which the average annual medical expense was $8621. A weight-loss intervention transitioning a patient to the next lower obesity class was predicted to reduce this risk by 1.5% to 27.4%-comparable to hypothetically curing a patient of depression or type 2 diabetes. Conclusion. A logistic model was used to capture the effect of BMI on the risk of high future medical spending. Weight-loss interventions for obese patients may generate significant savings by reducing this risk. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To estimate the cost to the workplace of implementing initiatives to reduce work- family conflict. Design. Prospective cost analysis conducted alongside a group-randomized multisite controlled experimental study, using a microcosting approach. Setting. An information technology firm. Subjects. Employees (n= 1004) and managers (n= 141) randomized to the intervention arm. Intervention. STAR (Start. Transform. Achieve. Results.) to enhance employees' control over their work time, increase supervisor support for employees to manage work and family responsibilities, and reorient the culture toward results. Measures. A taxonomy of activities related to customization, start-up, and implementation was developed. Resource use and unit costs were estimated for each activity, excluding research- related activities. Analysis. Economic costing approach (accounting and opportunity costs). Sensitivity analyses on intervention costs. Results. The total cost of STAR was $709,654, of which $389,717 was labor costs and $319,937 nonlabor costs (including $313,877 for intervention contract). The cost per employee participation in the intervention was $340 (95% confidence interval: $330-$351); $597 ($561-$634) for managers and $300 ($292-$308) for other employees (2011 prices). Conclusion. A detailed activity costing approach allows for more accurate cost estimates and identifies key drivers of cost. The key cost driver was employees' time spent on receiving the intervention. Ignoring this cost, which is usual in studies that cost workplace interventions, would seriously underestimate the cost of a workplace initiative. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To determine if two widely used behavioral change measures-Stages of Change (SoC) and Patient Activation Measure (PAM)-correlate with each other, are affected by financial incentives, or predict positive outcomes in the context of incentive-based health interventions.<bold>Design: </bold>Secondary analysis of two randomized controlled trials of incentives for weight loss and for improved diabetes self-monitoring.<bold>Setting: </bold>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Newark, New Jersey.<bold>Subjects: </bold>A total of 132 obese and 75 diabetic adults enrolled in one of two trials. MEASURES . SoC and PAM scores; weight loss and usage rate of diabetes self-monitoring equipment.<bold>Analysis: </bold>Multiple regression; Kruskal-Wallis test.<bold>Results: </bold>We found no association between baseline SoC and PAM scores in either study (p = .30 and p = .89). Regression models showed no association between baseline PAM score and SoC and subsequent outcomes for either study (weight loss study: PAM: p = .14, SoC: p = .1; diabetes study: PAM: p = .45, SoC: p = .61). Change in PAM score and SoC among participants in the intervention groups did not differ by study arm or among participants with better outcomes. CONCLUSION . PAM score and SoC may not effectively predict success or monitor progress among individuals enrolled in incentive-based interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

The most commonly cited benefits were psychosocial support and goal setting.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Care management programs may benefit from changes to how insurance plan members are selected for the program and from adjusting program content to address perceived needs among members.

AB- <bold>Synopsis: </bold>Despite their popularity and potential to promote health in large populations, the effectiveness of online social networks (e.g., Facebook) to improve health behaviors has been somewhat disappointing. Most of the research examining the effectiveness of such interventions has used randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It is asserted that the modest outcomes may be due to characteristics specific to both online social networks and RCTs. The highly controlled nature of RCTs stifles the dynamic nature of online social networks. Alternative and ecologically valid research designs that evaluate online social networks in real-life conditions are needed to advance the science in this area. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

However, little is known of factors that empower healthy eating. Antonovsky's salutogenesis provides an innovative framework to study these factors and identify resources and mechanisms underlying healthy eating practices. We give recommendations for future research and provide examples of how salutogenesis has inspired our own research to gain new insights into the origins of healthy eating. Lastly, implications of using future findings in designing novel nutrition promotion strategies are outlined. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The present study investigated an unexplored health behavior pathway: the association between living with a smoker and physical inactivity. Design. The study performed an analysis of cross-sectional data from the second wave of the Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (2004-2006). Subjects. The sample included 1050 women and 945 men, ages 30 to 84 years (mean, 56.5 years). Measures. In addition to control variables, survey items indexed presence of a smoker in the respondent's home, and physical inactivity and low health commitment on the part of the respondent. Analysis. Analysis employed m ultiple logistic regression analyses, controlling for sociodemographic factors as well as health restrictions on physical activity and respondents' current smoking status. Results. Living with a smoker was linked to 56 % higher- odds of physical inactivity. Low health commitment mediated this association. Living with a smoker was linked to lower health commitment (B= .31), and low health commitment was linked in turn to increased odds of physical inactivity (odds ratio, 1.36). Conclusions. The increased health risk among individuals living with a smoker is assumed to be a function of exposure to secondhand smoke. We demonstrate an unexplored behavioral pathway involving a link between living with a smoker and physical inactivity. These findings suggest that household smoking bans may have broad health behavior effects beyond reducing smoking. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this article was to describe the process by which research findings informed the successful passage of legislation designed to increase opportunities for physical activity in Mississippi, and discuss implications and lessons learned from this process. Design and Setting. The article is descriptive and conceptual, and addresses the collaborative process by which research, legal technical assistance, and advocacy informed and shaped shared use legislation in Mississippi. Subjects. Collaborators informing this article were an Active Living Research grantee, a staff attorney with the Public Health Law Center, the American Heart Association Mississippi Government Relations Director, and community partners. Results. The American Heart Association and Public Health Law Center developed policy guidance in the form of sample language for legislation as a starting point for states in determining policy needed to eliminate or reduce barriers to the shared use of school recreational facilities. The policy guidance was informed by evidence from Active Living Research-funded research studies. The American Heart Association, supporting a bill shaped by the policy guidance, led the effort to advocate for successful shared use legislation in Mississippi. Conclusion. Research should be policy relevant and properly translated and disseminated. Legal technical assistance should involve collaboration with both researchers and advocates so that policymakers have the information to make evidence-based decisions. Government relations directors should collaborate with legal technical staff to obtain and understand policy guidance relevant to their advocacy efforts. Effective collaborations, with an evidence-based approach, can lead to informed, successful policy change. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. State Safe Routes to School (SRTS) programs provide competitive grants to local projects that support safe walking, bicycling, and other modes of active school travel (AST). This study assessed changes in rates of AST after implementation of SRTS projects at multiple sites across four states. Design. One-group pretest and posttest. Setting. Florida, Mississippi, Washington, and Wisconsin. Subjects. Convenience sample of 48 completed SRTS projects and 53 schools affected by a completed SRTS project- Intervention. State-funded SRTS project. Measures. AST was measured as the percentage of students walking, bicycling, or using any AST mode. SRTS project characteristics were measured at the project, school, and school neighborhood levels. Analysis. Paired-samples t-tests were used to assess changes in AST. Bivariate analysis was used to identify SRTS project characteristics associated with increases in AST. Data were analyzed separately at the project (n = 48) and school (n - 53) levels. Results. Statistically significant increases in AST were observed across projects in all four stales. All AST modes increased from 12.9% to 17.6%; walking from 9.8% to 14.2%; and bicycling from 2.5% to 3.0%. Increases in rates of bicycling were negatively correlated with baseline rates of bicycling. Conclusion. State-funded SRTS projects are achieving one of the primary program goals of increasing rates of AST. They may be particularly effective at introducing bicycling to communities where it is rare. The evaluation framework introduced in this study can be used to continue tracking the effect of state SRTS programs as more projects are completed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To investigate the demographic, physical activity, and route characteristics related to children's school trips. Design. Cross-sectional exploratory study. Setting. Eighteen elementary schools in the Austin Independent School District, Austin, Texas. Subjects. One hundred twelve children aged 7 to 12 years. Measures. Accelerometer and Global Positioning System (GPS) devices provided objective measures of school travel and physical activity. Parental survey (response rate= 34.2%) provided children's demographic and household information. Analysis. Generalized linear regression analyses were used for unadjusted and adjusted models estimating correlates of total moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and school trip-related MVPA's contribution rate. Results. Walking trips were .44 miles (. 71 km) on average. Those who walked to school had about 11 more minutes of daily MVPA than nonwalkers (35.03 vs. 24.06) and higher proportions of their daily MVPA obtained from school commute trips (21. 78% vs. 2.41 %). School trips accounted for 11.2% of total daily MVPA on average, 12.9% for those who met the physical activity recommendation, and 35.2 % for the sedentary children who belonged to the lowest MVPA quartile. Conclusion. Active, school commuting appears to be a valuable means to promote physical activity, and its contributions toward total physical activity vary across different demographic groups and community settings. Objective and detailed data from GPS and accelerometer units can facilitate the assessment of route/trip characteristics and physical activity implications of school transportation.

AB- Purpose. To investigate the implementation of state- and school-mandated physical education (PE) and physical activity policies on students ' school-day physical activity behaviors. Design. Observational, cross-sectional study. Setting. Five elementary schools in rural Alabama. Subjects. Six hundred and eighty-three school-age children. Measures. School-day physical activity behaviors were assessed with pedometer step count, the System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time (SOFIT), and the System for Observing Play and Leisure Activity in Youth (SOPLAY). Analysis. Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) were used to describe the current health and in-school physical activity behaviors of students. Results. Students accumulated a daily average of 4079.57 (±1678.1) and 3473.44 (± 1073.37) steps for boys and girls, respectively, throughout the school day. SOFIT findings indicate that students spent an average of 23.80 ± 5.33 min/d in PE and that 14.33 ± 6.10 min/d were spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). This equates to 59.38 % of PE time spent in MVPA. SOPLAY findings showed that recess and before/after school activity was not provided. Conclusions. It appears that schools were in compliance with the state-mandated PE policies on paper but not in actuality. Students did not attend PE for 30 min/d. The implementation of PE as the sole physical activity opportunity provides inadequate amounts of physical activity during the school day. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine which school sports engage children in more physical activity. Design. Observational, cross-sectional study examining differences between intramural (IM) and interscholaslic (IS) sports. Setting. Athletic facilities at two schools with IM sports and two schools with IS sports in Wake County, North Carolina. Subjects. Middle-school children (N= 6735) Measures. Percentage of children observed in sedentary, moderate, and vigorous activity assessed by the System for Observation Play and Leisure Among Youth (SOPLAY). Energy expenditure and physical activity intensity were also estimated by using MET values. Analysis. T-tests; generalized linear model using cumulative logit link function. Results. IM sports had higher MET values than IS sports (t = -3.69, p < .001), and IM sports ranked in four of the top five sports in terms of average MET values. Regression models found a significant interaction between school sport delivery model and gender, with boys significantly less physically active in IS programs than boys in IM programs (B = -.447, p < .001) but more physically active (B= .359, p <.001) than girls in IM sports. Conclusion. Regardless of sport type, IM sports generated more physical activity than IS sports among boys but not girls. Soccer, basketball, and track, regardless of school delivery approach, provide the highest physical activity levels. Results suggest that school administrators consider reassessing their programs to more efficiently use. diminishing resources to increase students' physical activity levels. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To test effectiveness of Active School Day policy implementation on physical activity outcomes and estimate school-level implementation costs. Design. The design of the study was quasi-experimental (pretest-posttest matched controls). Setting. The study took place in six elementary schools with three matched pairs in Boston, Massachusetts, February to June 2011. Subjects. Subjects were 455 consenting fourth- and fifth-grade students among 467 eligible. Intervention. Active School Day policy implementation provided equipment, curricular materials, and training to physical educators and school Wellness champions to promote 150 weekly minutes of quality physical education, recess, and physical activity integrated into classrooms. Measures. Accelerometer assessments of accumulated minutes and bouts of moderate, vigorous, and sedentary physical activity on 5 school days before and after implementation were used. Implementation costs were collected by record review and reported resource utilization. Analysis. Analysis was conducted using multivariale mixed models estimated with repeated "measures of daily physical activity, adjusted for student demographics and other confounding and design/clustering variables. Results. Accelerometer data were provided by 201 intervention and 192 comparison students for an average of 4 days per period (84 % response). During school time, students in intervention schools demonstrated greater increases in minutes per day of moderate-lo-vigorous physical activity (3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-6.0; p < .001) and vigorous physical activity (1.8, 95% CI. 7-3.0; p < .001), and greater decreases in minutes per day of sedentary time (-10.6, 95% CI -15.3 5.8; p < .001) than controls. Ongoing annual implementation costs totaled $4,523/school ($14/student). Conclusion. Active School Day implementation increased student moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels by 24% and decreased sedentary time during school at modest cost. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine school socioeconomic status (SES) in relation to school physical activity-related practices and children's physical activity. Design. A cross-sectional design, was used for this study. Setting. The study was set in 97 elementary schools; (63% response rate) in two U.S. regions. Subjects. Of the children taking part in this study, 172 were aged 10.2 (standard deviation (SD) = 1.5) years; 51.7% were girls, and 69.2% were White non-Hispanic. Measures. School physical education (PE) teachers or principals responded to 15 yes/no questions on school physical activity-supportive practices. School SES (low, moderate, high) was derived from the percent of students eligible for free and reduced-price lunch. Children's moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during school was measured with accelerometers. Analysis. School level analyses involved linear and logistic regression; children's MVPA analyses used mixed effects regression. Results. Low-SES schools were less likely to have a PE teacher and had fewer physical activity- supportive PE practices than did high-SES schools (p < . 05). Practices related to active travel to school were more favorable at low-SES schools (p < .05). Children attending high-SES schools had 4.4 minutes per day more of MVPA during school than did those at low-SES schools, but this finding was not statistically significant (p = . 124). Conclusion. These findings suggest that more low- and moderate-SES elementary schools need PE teachers in order to reduce disparities in school physical activity opportunities and that PE time needs to be supplemented by classroom teachers or other staff to meet guidelines.

AB- Purpose. To examine support for local policies encouraging physical activity and perceived neighborhood environment characteristics by physical activity and weight status of respondents across U.S. counties. Design. We used a random-digit-dial, computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) to conduct a cross- sectional telephone questionnaire in selected U.S. counties in 2011. Setting. Counties with high prevalences of obesity and sedentary behavior (HH; n = 884) and counties with low prevalences of obesity and sedentary behavior (LL; re = 171) were selected nationally. Subjects. Adult respondents from HH (n = 642) and LL (n = 566) counties. Measures. Questions were asked of respondents, pertaining to support for physical activity policies in various settings, neighborhood features, time spent in physical activity and sedentary behaviors, self- reported weight and height, and personal demographic information. Analysis. Means and frequencies were calculated; bivariable and multivariable linear and logistic regression models, developed. Models were adjusted for individual characteristics and county HH/LL status. Results. Respondents in LL counties perceived their neighborhood and work environments to be more supportive of healthy behaviors and were more supportive of local physical activity policies than respondents in HH counties (p < .001 for all). Positive neighborhood environment perceptions were related to reduced body mass index, increased physical activity, and decreased sedentary behavior. Conclusion. Policy support and neighborhood environments are associated with behaviors. Results can inform targeting policy agendas to facilitate the improvement of environments (community, work, and school) to be more supportive of physical activity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To evaluate the effectiveness of Preventing Obesity by Design (POD), a childcare center outdoor renovation intervention. Design. Pre-post intervention evaluation. Setting. North Carolina licensed childcare centers (N= 27). Subjects. Preschool children. Intervention. Outdoor renovation, teacher training. Measures. Behavior mapping, Preschool Outdoor Environment Measurement Scale (POEMS), center director interview. Analysis. Descriptive statistics, ordinary least squares and logistic regressions calculated to assess levels of association between environmental change, children's physical activity (PA), social behaviors, and environmental quality. Qualitative interview data analyzed lo help understand intervention impact. Results. Behavior mapping showed that site layout attributes, such as the form (i.e., "single loop" and "double loop" ) of pathways (functioning as circulation routes and wheeled toy settings), are associated with higher levels of PA. Teacher interaction was associated with decreased children's PA. Absence of teacher or lack of child/child interaction was associated with increased PA. POEMS assessment of environmental quality was higher after renovation. POEMS domains (Physical Space and Teacher/ Caregiver Roles) were positively associated with PA. After renovation, 68% of center directors reported positive changes in children s behavior and 40 % mentioned edible plant installations as greatest success. Conclusion. Built environment renovation of childcare center outdoors, including looped pathways installation, coupled with teacher training, may support increased PA. Renovation., including food, gardens, may be a key to success for preschool health promotion and support change in childcare policy. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To assess the use of new pocket parks in low-income neighborhoods. Design. The design of the study was a quasi-experimental post-test only comparison. Setting. Los Angeles, California, was the setting for the study. Subjects. Subjects were park users and residents living within .5 mile of three pocket parks and 15 neighborhood parks. Intervention. The creation of pocket parks. Measures. We used the System of Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) tool to measure park use and park-based physical activity, and then surveyed park users and residents about their park use. Analysis. We surveyed 392 and 432 household members within .5 mile of the three pocket parks before and after park construction, respectively, as well as 71 pocket park users, and compared them to 992 neighborhood park users and 342 residents living within .5 mile of other neighborhood parks. We compared pocket park use to playground area use in the larger neighborhood parks. We used descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations for the analysis. Results. Overall, pocket park use compared favorably in promoting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with that of existing playground space in nearby parks, and they were cost- effective at $0.13/MET hour (metabolic equivalent hour) gained. Pocket park visitors walked an average of .25 miles to get to a park. Conclusions. Pocket parks, when perceived as attractive and safe destinations, may increase physical activity by encouraging families with children to walk there. Additional strategies and programs may be needed to encourage more residents to use these parks. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Evaluate the implementation of a government planning policy (Liveable Neighbourhoods Guidelines) and its impacts on residents ' walking behaviors. Design. Cross-sectional study of participants from the RESIDential Environments project (RESIDE). Setting. Nineteen "liveable" and 17 "conventionally designed' housing developments across Perth, Western Australia. Subjects. Five hundred ninety-four participants from. RESIDE who resided in 36 housing developments. Measures. Developed in geographic information systems to assess the on-ground implementation of 43 policy requirements. Policy compliance was defined as the degree to which construction of the developments adhered to the standards outlined. Walking behaviors were measured using the Neighborhood Physical Activity Questionnaire. K-means cluster analyses identified groups of homogeneous developments with respect to policy implementation. Analysis. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations estimated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs)for the likelihood of undertaking any and ≥ 60 minutes of transport and recreational walking associated with (1) policy compliance and (2) different clusters of developments. Results. There were few significant differences in on-ground outcomes between the two development types. Despite incomplete implementation, the odds of walking for transport increased with overall levels of policy compliance (0R= 1.53, 95% CI 1.13-2.08) and compliance with the community design (0R = 1.3, 95% CI 1.13-1.42), movement network (0R= 2.49, 95% CI 1.38-4.50), and lot layout elements (0R= 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.50). Conclusion. Consistent with the aims of the policy, residents in walkable (i.e., liveable) neighborhoods may be more physically active. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between street connectivity and road traffic speed and neighborhood residents' use of parks and park-based physical activity. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. Kansas City, Missouri. Subjects. Participants were 893 adults from randomly selected households. Measures. Both self-reported park use and park-based physical activity were dichotomized as some versus none. Intersection density was calculated around each participant, and network analysis was used to determine whether participants had to travel on or cross a road with traffic speed greater than 35 miles per hour (mph) to reach the closest park. Analysis. Multilevel logistic regression examined the association between intersection density and traffic speed wit park use and park-based physical activity. Results. Compared to those in the lowest intersection density quartile, participants in the third and fourth quartiles were more likely to use parks and to engage in physical activity in parks (odds ratio [0R]= 1. 76-2.34; all p < .05). Likewise, compared to those who had a high-speed road on their way to the closest park, participants with slower traffic routes to parks were more likely to use the parks (0R= 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-1.92). Conclusion. In addition to park proximity and the design of park features, ensuring direct and safe access to parks through street network design and traffic speed reduction strategies may be key to facilitating bark-related physical activity.

AB- Purpose. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions. Public health practitioners are distinctly positioned to promote the environmental changes essential to addressing obesity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other entities provide evidence and technical assistance to support this work, yet little is known about how practitioners use evidence and support as they intervene to prevent obesity. The study's purpose was to describe how practitioners and CDC project officers characterized the obesity prevention task, where practitioners accessed support, and evidence, and what approaches to support and evidence they found most useful. Approach or Design. Mixed-methods, cross-sectional interviews, and survey. Setting. Stale-level public health obesity prevention programs. Participants. Public health practitioners and CDC project officers. Method. We conducted 10 in-depth interviews with public health practitioners (n = 7) and project officers (n= 3) followed by an online survey completed by 62practitioners (50% response rate). We applied content analysis to interview data and descriptive statistics to survey data. Results. Practitioners characterized obesity prevention as uncertain and complex, involving interdependence among actors, multiple levels of activity, an excess of information, and a paucity of evidence. Survey findings provide further detail on the types of evidence and support practitioners used and valued. Conclusion. We recommend approaches to tailoring evidence and support to the needs of practitioners working on obesity prevention and other complex health problems. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine whether prepregnancy weight was associated with children's birth weight, early physical growth, and autism diagnosis. Design. Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort data. Setting. United States. Subjects. Representative sample of U.S. children followed from birth through kindergarten (n = 4800). Also, a subpopulation of the very low birth weight children was examined (n= 500). Measures. Maternal variables included age and prepregnancy body mass index. Changes in children's height, weight, and head circumference between 9 months and 2 years were used as growth metrics. Children's sex, age, birth weight, and reported autism were also considered. Analysis. Logistic and multinomial logistic models assessed the impact of prepregnancy weight on birth weight and children's subsequent rate of physical growth and autism. Results. Children born to underweight or obese mothers had increased odds of very low birth weight. Very low birth weight was related to rapid, height and weight growth and more than twice the likelihood to subsequently be diagnosed with autism. For the subgroup of very low birth weight children, rapid head growth was related to a fivefold increase in the odds of autism. After accounting for the impact birth weight and growth rates, we found prepregnancy weight indirectly impacted autism risk. Conclusion. Being underweight or obese during prepregnancy indirectly increased risk for autism from increased odds of low birth weight and accelerated postnatal growth. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To compare public and policy maker support for three point-of-sale tobacco policies. Design. Two cross-sectional surveys-one of the public from the New York Adult Tobacco Survey and one of policy makers from the Local Opinion Leader Survey; both collected and analyzed in 2011. Setting. Tobacco control programs focus on educating the public and policy makers about. tobacco control policy solutions. Subjects. Six hundred seventy-six county-level legislators in New York's 62 counties and New York City's five boroughs (response rate: 59%); 7439 New York residents aged 18 or older. Landline response rates: 20.2% to 22%. Cellphone response rates: 9.2% to 11.1%. Measures. Gender, age, smoking status, presence of a child aged 18 years or younger in the. household, county of residence, and policy maker and public support for three potential policy solutions to point-of-sale tobacco marketing. Analysis, t-tests to compare the demographic makeup for the two samples. Adjusted Wald tests to test for differences in policy support between samples. Results. The public was significantly more supportive of point-of-sale policy solutions than were policy makers: cap on retailers (48.0% vs. 19.2%, respectively); ban on sales at pharmacies (49.1% vs. 38.8%); and ban on retailers near schools (53.3% vs. 42.5%). Limitations: cross-sectional data, sociodemographic differences, and variations in item wording. Conclusions. Tobacco control programs need to include information about implementation, enforcement, and potential effects on multiple constituencies (including businesses) in their efforts to educate policy makers about point-of-sale policy solutions.

AB- Purpose. Indoor tanning (IT) increases risk for melanoma and is particularly common among young adult women. IT has also been linked with some psychiatric symptoms, and frequent tanning may indicate tanning dependence (addiction) associated with endorphin release, during ultraviolet radiation exposure. The objective of the current study was to investigate associations between IT, tanning dependence, and psychiatric and substance use symptoms in young adult women. Design. Cross-sectional survey and psychiatric interview. Setting. Online, except for the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), which was completed over the telephone. Subjects. Participants were 306 female university students aged 18 to 25 years. Measures. MINI, Seasonal Scale Index, tanning dependence scales, reporting ever having used a tanning bed or booth with tanning lamps (single item), reporting smoking a cigarette in the last 30 days (single item). Analysis. Descriptive statistics, x2 analysis, multivariate logistic regression. Results. Forty-six percent of the sample reported a history of IT, and 25% were classified as tanning dependent. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that IT was significantly associated with symptoms of alcohol use disorders, generalized anxiety, and not having social anxiety. Tanning dependence was associated with symptoms of alcohol use disorders. Conclusion. Tanning is of concern not only for its association with skin cancer but for its association with psychiatric and substance use symptoms. Young women with certain psychological problems may seek relief from their symptoms by IT. These findings suggest that indoor tanners may benefit from health behavior and other psychosocial interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. The purpose of this paper was to explore the effect of recess interventions on children's physical activity (PA) levels and to examine which specific interventions/ characteristics have more influence on children's PA Data Source. Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, ProQuest, SPORT Discus Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Papers published between 1986 and 2012, published in the English language, and evaluating any recess intervention with PA as an outcome Data Extraction. Study outcomes were distilled into seven domains related to PA: age, gender, intervention type, intervention duration, duration of PA per intervention session, outcome measures, and study region Data Synthesis. Effect sizes were pooled within and across studies for each domain separately. Moderator analyses were performed using gender, age, and total length of intervention. Twenty-three independent samples were provided from 13 studies. Results. The estimated overall effect size for time in PA was 56 (SE .07), suggesting a positive and significant mean difference between pretest and posttest PA time after implementing a recess intervention. Differences in PA levels were moderated by age, duration and type of intervention, and type of outcome measures. Conclusion. The limited evidence suggests recess interventions can improve youth PA levels. Implications reinforce the importance of schools in advocating for recess during the school day. Strategies shown to increase student PA during recess should be implemented. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine whether there are differences between demographic, behavioral, and biological variables for those with invalid accelerometry data (IAD) and those with valid accelerometry data (VAD) Design. Cross-sectional Setting. Data from 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used Subjects. Participants included 1,315 children (ie., 6-11 years) with VAD and 534 children with IAD and 1,859 adolescents (i.e., 12-17years) with VAD and 1,057 with IAD. Measures. Physical activity (PA) was measured using an accelerometer, with questionnaires used to assess demographic and behavioral variables and biological parameters assessed from a blood sample Analysis. Wald and design-based likelihood ratio tests and, logistic regression were used to assess differences between those subjects with IAD and those with VAD Results. After adjustments, overweight children, compared to normal weight children, were 1.6 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22-2.29) times more likely to have IAD. After adjustments, and as an example, adolescents engaging in 4 or more hours of computer use per day, compared to no computer use, were 2.6 (OR = 2.6; 95 % CI: 1.38-5.18) times more likely to have IAD. Conclusion. Excluding youth with IAD may introduce bias, limit generalizability, and ultimately underestimate the association between PA and health outcomes Future research is needed to identify reasons for poor monitoring compliance.

AB- Purpose. Existing literature shows negative relationships between gasoline price and motor vehicle crashes, particularly among teens. This paper extends that literature by evaluating the relationship between gasoline price and self-reported risky driving among teens. Design. Observational study using multivariate empirical analysis, using pooled data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, waves 2003-2009. Setting. Secondary data from survey administered in private and public high schools across the United States. Subjects. Students in grades 9 through 12, surveyed biennially from 2003 to 2009 (n - 58,749). Measures. Outcomes are (self-reported) driving without seatbelts, driving after consuming alcohol, and moderate physical activity (like walking or bicycling). State-level retail gasoline prices constitute the main predictor variable. Analysis. Multivariate logistic models are estimated for the full sample, as well as by gender, race/ethnicity, and age. Individual characteristics, state unemployment, and stale driving policies are controlled for. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Results are reported in form of risk differences. Results. Higher gasoline prices are negatively and significantly associated with driving without seatbelts. Associations are particularly strong for males and minorities. There are fewer statistical associations between gasoline prices and driving after drinking. Higher gasoline prices are positively associated with more moderate physical activity. Conclusion. Higher gasoline prices are associated with less risky driving behaviors among teens, and they may be associated with more active forms of transportation, like walking and bicycling. The study limitations are discussed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- This commentary reviews findings from the four previous national surveys of workplace health promotion activities (1985, 1992, 1999, and 2004, respectively) and offers recommendations for future surveys mandated under the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Future surveys should place greater emphasis on assessing program quality, reach, and effectiveness. Both employer and employee input should be sought. In addition, sampling plans should differentiate worksites from employers, and results should include public as well as private sector organizations. Ideas are offered for addressing these limitations and for creating a sustainable survey process and multifunctional database, of results. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- The author reflects on the measurement of workplace wellness using financial return on investment with medical care cost savings. He questions if employers place as great a priority on return on investment as research suggests or if they are more concerned on the impact the programs have on the core priorities of their organization. He considers the primary concerns of upper management, and whether the importance of the broader contribution of workplace wellness programs has been overlooked.

AB- Purpose. To examine the effectiveness of multilevel promotion on exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) duration and prevalence. Design. A pretest-posttest control group design, quasi-experiment. Setting. Two public health centers in the Demak District, Central Java, Indonesia. Subjects. A total of 163 families were enrolled, including pregnant mothers, fathers, and grandmothers. Intervention. The multilevel promotion of EBF was conducted at the subdistrict, village, family, and individual levels. This was a complex intervention that modified breastfeeding determinants, integrated multidisciplinary partnerships, and involved community leaders (i.e., voluntary health workers, traditional birth attendants, Muslim scholars, and heads of villages). The strategies applied were advocacy, training, media, and home visit counseling. Measures. EBF duration and prevalence. Analysis. Survival analyses, Cox proportional-hazard model. Results. The duration of EBF increased after the multilevel promotion. The median postintervention duration in the intervention group was 18 weeks compared with .1 week in the control group (p < .001). The prevalence of EBF at 1, 8, 16, and 24 weeks for the intervention versus control groups was 75.3% vs. 28.0%, 64.2% vs. 14.6%, 50.6% vs. 8.5%, and 37.0% vs. 3.7%, respectively (p < .001). Mothers in the control group were three times more likely to stop exclusive breastfeeding per unit of time than were mothers in the intervention group (adjusted hazard ratio 3.01; 95% confidence interval: 1.96, 4.63). Conclusion. Multilevel promotion can prolong the duration and increase the prevalence of EBF. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To assess the effects of predeployment and deployment-related factors on dimensions of wellness following deployment. Design. Prospective longitudinal study. The dependent variable was dimensions of wellness. Independent variables were measured in terms of modifiable, nonmodifiable, and military factors, such as sex, race/ethnicity, service branch, smoking status, and combat experience. Setting. A large military cohort participating in the Millennium Cohort Study. Subjects. Included 10,228 participants who deployed in support of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Measures. Dimensions of wellness were measured by using standardized instruments assessing self-reported physical health, mental health, and stress. Covariates were measured by using self-reported and electronic data. Analysis. Factors of postdeployment wellness were assessed by using ordinal logistic regression. Results. Most participants (78.7%) were categorized as ‘‘moderately well’’ post deployment. Significant modifiable predeployment predictors of postdeployment wellness included normal/underweight body mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 1.72, p < .05). Military factors significantly associated with wellness included not experiencing combat (OR = .56, p < .05), member of Air Force (OR = 2.02, p < .05) or Navy/Coast Guard (OR = 1.47, p < .05), and combat specialist occupation (OR = 1.22, p < .05). Conclusion. Multiple modifiable factors associated with postdeployment wellness were identified, which may help inform medical and military leadership on potential strategies to ensure a well force. Those trained in combat roles were more likely to be well post deployment though this apparent benefit was not conferred onto those reporting combat experiences. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Health risk appraisals (HRAs) have been used to address multiple health concerns and lifestyle behaviors. We explore the longitudinal relationship between emotional health, stage of change for five lifestyle behaviors, and lifestyle risks using HRA-generated data. Design. Secondary analysis of 3 years of HRA data. Setting. A large health care management services provider. Subjects. A total of 7535 adults employed across three companies who completed consecutive HRAs over a 3-year period. Measures. Self-report items concerning participant health, lifestyle behaviors, disease risk factors, job/life satisfaction, safety, and biometrics. Analysis. Structural equation modeling tested a hypothesized longitudinal, fully cross-lagged panel design. Results. Results indicated that greater numbers of physical and behavioral risks classified as high risk were associated with greater intention to change or an actual change in lifestyle behavior in the following year. In addition, poorer emotional health was associated with a higher number of risks. Conclusion. Data from repeat participation in HRAs can be useful in studying multiple risk behaviors and related health measures, supporting the design and evaluation of effective, individualized, and responsive health promotion activities for ivorking adults.

AB- Purpose. To assess whether forming general behavioral intentions and implementing intentions through action plans promotes weight loss and is moderated by weight loss goals and self-efficacy. Design. A quasi-experimental study comparing change in body mass index (BMI) for 15 months between a behavioral intentions condition (BIC), an implementation intentions condition (IIC), and a comparison condition (CC). Setting. Ten-week weight loss program delivered in weekly group meetings at community medical centers. Subjects. Six hundred thirty-two attendants at the weight loss program (80% of program attendants participated in the study). Intervention. Weight loss program focused on lifestyle changes, augmented by two experimental conditions (vs. a comparison condition): BIC, intended use of weight loss techniques; IIC, intended use and detailed plans for two techniques. Phone follow-up was conducted 3 and 12 months later. Measures. Main outcome: BMI during the program (computed on the basis of weight and height measured on a mechanical medical scale). Experimental manipulations included exposure, to list of techniques (BIC/IIC) and structured planning form (IIC); independent variables were assessed with questionnaires (eating self- efficacy, weight loss goal, demographics). Analysis. Linear mixed models estimating changes in BMI and their interactions with the planning interventions, goals, and self-efficacy. Results. Participants in the BIC and IIC lost 40% more weight during the 10-week program than those in the CC(1.10 and 1.11 BMI points compared with .79;ts<-2.76,ps< .01). Weight loss goals interacted with implementation intentions (1= 2.98, p < .01). Self-efficacy was unrelated to weight loss. No differences were found between conditions at 3 and 12 months after the program. Conclusion. Findings revealed that forming implementation intentions promotes weight loss within a weekly program at afield setting and that its effectiveness depends on initial high goals. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Demographic and outcome data that included adherence, self-advocacy, and stigma; collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 months. Analysis. Repeated-measures analysis of variance scores were examined between groups and waves. Paired-sample t-tests were used to examine mean differences across time. Results. Sample included 110 women (intervention, n = 56; comparison, n = 54). Retention was 85.5%. Repeated-measures analysis indicated intervention group condom use (n= 69, F= 8.02, df= 1, p < .01) and safe sex fn= 71, F= 13.02, df= 1, p< .01) was higher than that of comparison group. A time effect was also found in the Silencing the Self Scale (n = 91, Pillai's trace= 7.21, df= 2, p < .01). Conclusion. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a tailored, peer-led, and culturally relevant interventions and tentative efficacy in populations affected by health disparities. Key limitations include no comparison intervention format with women who can't write and the need to test generalizability. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine predictors of voluntary home-smoking restrictions (HSRs) and associations with an objective measure of in-home smoking. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. Publicly subsidized multiunit housing units managed by private company in Columbus, Ohio, without a smoke-free housing policy. Subjects. Probability sample of primary leaseholders (N= 301, 64% response rate). Measures. Self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors collected during face-to-face survey in fall 2011, including individual (e.g., knowledge of health effects), social (e.g., number of friends who smoke), and environmental (e.g., safety) factors hypothesized to be related to having HSRs. Surface nicotine concentration (μg/m2) based on samples collected from wood surface in respondents' living rooms (n = 279). Analysis. Multiple linear and logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with having HSRs and with indoor surface nicotine concentrations. Results. Fewer than one-third (29.2%) of tenants had complete HSRs, while more than half (55.8%) had partial restrictions. Several individual and social factors, but no environmental/community factors, were associated with having HSRs. Type of HSRs (p < .001) and smoking status (p < .001) were independently associated with mean surface nicotine concentrations. Conclusion. Few subsidized housing tenants voluntarily limit in-home smoking. Partial restrictions could be considered as a harm reduction strategy but may be less effective among smokers. Strategies to change social norms are also needed to modify in-home smoking behavior among subsidized housing tenants. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Little is known about veterans service organizations (VSOs) and their perspectives on veterans smoking or military tobacco control. Veterans have high smoking rates and many started smoking in the military, where a culture promoting use exists. Design. A qualitative content analysis of VSO Web sites was conducted to classify health topics and identify tobacco-related information. Setting. Web sites were coded by trained raters from January to June of 2011. Data were entered, cleaned, and analyzed from July 2011 to January 2012. Subjects. Twenty-four active VSO Web sites meeting inclusion criteria were rated independently. Measures. A comprehensive form was used to code 15 veteran-relevant health topics across multiple content areas/domains within the Web sites. Haters achieved 94.5% interrater agreement over nearly 5000 data points. Analysis. Health content was coded as present or not within multiple VSO Web site areas/ domains. The frequency of coverage by each VSO Web site and the number of VSO Web sites that mentioned a health topic in different Web site areas/domains were tabulated. Results. A total of 277 health topics were addressed, with the top five being insurance/ Tricare/Veterans Administration issues (28.2%), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 15.5%), disability/amputation/wounds (13.4%), Agent Orange (10.5%), and traumatic brain injury (9.0%). Tobacco was mentioned four limes (1.4%) across all 24 VSO Web sites, and smoking cessation was never addressed. Conclusion. VSO Web sites provide little information on tobacco-related topics and none offered information about smoking cessation. Given the high rates of tobacco use among veterans and active-duty service members, and the interaction between smoking and PTSD symptoms and treatment outcomes, VSOs should consider making tobacco control and smoking cessation higher-priorily health issues on their Web sites.

AB- Purpose. To examine the association between college students' dietary patterns and frequency of purchasing food/beverages from campus area venues, purchasing fast food, and bringing food from home. Design. Cross-sectional Student Health and Wellness Study. Setting. One community college and one public university in the Twin Cities, Minnesota. Subjects. Diverse college students living off campus (n= 1059; 59% nonwhite; mean [SD] age, 22 [5] years). Measures. Participants self-reported sociodemographic characteristics and frequency of purchasing food/beverages around campus, purchasing fast food, and bringing food from home. Campus area purchases included à la carte, facilities, vending machines, beverages, and nearby restaurants/'stores. Dietary outcomes included breakfast and evening meal consumption (d/wk) and summary variables of fruit and vegetable, dairy, calcium, fiber, added sugar, and fat intake calculated from food frequency screeners. Analysis. The associations between each purchasing behavior and dietary outcomes were examined using t-tests and linear regression. Results. Approximately 45% of students purchased food/beverages from at least one campus area venue >3 times per week. Frequent food/beverage purchasing around campus was associated with less frequent breakfast consumption and higher fat and added sugar intake, similar to fast-food purchasing. Bringing food from home was associated with healthier dietary patterns. Conclusion. Increasing the healthfulness of campus food environments and promoting healthy food and beverage purchasing around campuses may be an important target for nutrition promotion among college students.

AB- Purpose. To determine if changes in physical activity were associated with changes in fruit and Design. Prospective cohort. Setting. Hawaii. Subjects. Seven hundred adults (18+- years) sampled from the general population. Measures. Computer-assisted telephone interviews conducted at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months; the International Physical Activity Questionnaire; the National Cancer Institute's Fruit and Vegetable Screener. Analysis. Between-individual correlations of each individual's mean physical activity and mean fruit and vegetable intake were estimated with Pearson correlations. Correlations of physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake within individuals over time were calculated from analysis of covariance models to factor out the variation between individuals. Results. Individuals with a higher mean physical activity duration tended to eat more fruits and vegetables (r=.3O, p < .0001). Within individuals, no average correlation between physical activity and intake of fruit and vegetables was observed over lime (r = . 03). The variation was great in that some individuals, these behaviors changed simultaneously, but in others, they did not. Conclusion. Although individuals who are more physically active tend to eat more fruits and vegetables (i.e., there is a weak correlation between individuals), on average, individuals do not simultaneously change these behaviors. Implications are that health behaviors may not covary, or that intervention is necessary to bring about covariation in health behaviors. The great variation from individual to individual in the extent to which these two behaviors covaried needs to be studied to determine if the individual tendency for behaviors to covary could be measured and used to individually tailor multiple behavior interventions.

AB- Purpose. The aims of the current study were to (1) determine the association between personal income and body mass index (BMI) and between individual education and BMI, and (2) examine the association between education and BMJ across strata ofpersonal income among women. Design. The design of the study was a quantitative analysis of data from self-report questionnaires. Setting. The study setting was socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods in Victoria, Australia. Subjects. The study included 4065 nonpregnant women (ages 18-45 years) living in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. Measures. The study used a self-report questionnaire measuring sociodemographic characteristics known to be associated with BMI. Analysis. Multiple linear regressions with imputation were used to assess the association between education level, personal income, and BMI, while controlling for covariates. Results. Mean (SD) observed BMJ was 26.0 (6.1) kg/m2. Compared with women with low education, women with medium (b = -0.81; 95% confidence interval, -1.30 to -0.27; p = .004) and high (b = -1. 71; 95% confidence interval, -2.34 to -1.09; p < .001) education had statistically significantly lower BMI values. No differences in BMI were observed between income categories. Stratified analyses suggested that the education-BMI association may be stronger in low-income than higher-income women. Conclusion. Our data show that among women living in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, high education level rather than personal income may be protective against overweight/cbesity. High personal income, however, may buffer the effects of low education on BMI. Obesity prevention efforts should target women with amplified disadvantage. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the effects of a comprehensive, school-wide social-emotional and character development program using a positive youth development perspective. Specifically, we examined a mediation mechanism whereby positive academic-related behaviors mediated the intervention effects on substance use, violence, and sexual activity. Design. Matched-pair, cluster-randomized, controlled design. Setting. Twenty (10 intervention and 10 control) racially/ethnically diverse schools in Hawaii. Subjects. Elementary-aged students (N = 1784) from grade 5. Intervention. The Positive Action program. Measures. Students self-reported their academic behaviors, together with their substance use, violence, and voluntary sexual activity; teachers rated students' academic behaviors, substance use, and violence. Analysis. Structural equation modeling Results. Students attending intervention schools reported significantly better academic behavior (B = .273, SE= .039, p < .001) and significantly less substance use (B=-.970, SE= .292, p < .01, incidence-rate ratio [IRR]= .379), violence (B= -1.410, SE= .296, p < .001, IRR= .244), and sexual activity (B= -2.415, SE= .608, p < .001, odds ratio= .089); boys reported more negative behaviors than girls. Intervention effects on student-reported substance use, violence, and sexual activity were mediated by positive academic behavior. Teacher reports corroborated these results, with rated academic behavior partially mediating the effects of the intervention on rated negative behaviors. Conclusion. This study (1) provides evidence that adds insight into one mechanism through which a social-emotional and character development program affects negative outcomes and (2) supports social-emotional and character development and positive youth development perspectives that posit that focusing on youths' assets may reduce negative behaviors.

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this study was to test if moderate to vigorous physical activity (MI/PA) in less than the recommended ≥ 10-minute bouts related to weight outcomes. Design. Secondary data analysis. Setting. Random sample from the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Participants. A total of 4511 adults aged 18 to 64 years from the 2003-2006 NHANES. Method. Clinically measured body mass index (BMJ) and overweight/obese status were regressed on accelerometer measures of minutes per day in higher-intensity long bouts (≥ 10 minutes, ≥ 2020 accelerometer counts per minute [cpm]), higher-intensity short bouts (<10 minutes, >2020 cpm), lower-intensity long bouts (≥ 10 minutes, 760-2019 cpm), and lower- intensity short bouts (<10 minutes, 760-2019 cpm). Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were controlled. Results. Both higher-intensity short bouts and long bouts of PA related to lower BMJ and risk of overweight/obesity. Neither lower-intensity short bouts nor long bouts related to BMI or risk of overweight/obesity. Conclusion. The current ≥ 10-minute MVPA bouts guideline was based on health benefits other than weight outcomes. Our findings showed that for weight gain prevention, accumulated higher-intensity PA bouts of <10 minutes are highly beneficial, supporting the public health promotion message that "every minute counts."

AB- Purpose. To evaluate the effectiveness of addressing multiple barriers to physical activity (PA) using interventions at the workplace. Design. The Physical Activity and Lifestyle Study used a randomized controlled trial in which 60 university departments were randomized into five groups. Setting. Large Southeastern university Subjects. Physically inactive nonfaculty employees in the participating departments (n = 410) were interviewed five times over 9 months, with 82% completing all surveys. Intervention. Departments were randomly assigned to (1) control, (2) gym membership, (3) gym + PA education, (4) gym + time during the workday, and (5) gym + education + time. Measures. PA intensity and quantity were measured using the 7-day Physical Activity Recall instrument, with PA then classified as the number of days meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Analysis. The outcome was modeled with generalized linear mixed model methodology. Results. There was no significant improvement when a group received gym alone compared to the control (Rate Ratio [RR]) 1.22 [.90, 1.67]). However, gym + education, gym + time, and gym + education + time were significantly better than the control (RR 1.51 [1.15, 1.98], RR 1.46 [1.13, 1.88], RR 1.28 [1.01, 1.62]), with improvements sustained over the 9 months. Conclusion. Among sedentary adults who had access to indoor exercise facilities, addressing environmental and cognitive barriers simultaneously (i.e., time and education) did not encourage more activity than addressing either barrier alone.

AB- Purpose. Neighborhood built environments are related to obesity and physical activity (PA), but inconsistently to sedentary behaviors. This study investigated the mediating effects of PA and sedentary time on the associations of neighborhood environmental factors and body mass index (BMI) among Nigerian adults. Design. The study design wa.s cross-sectional. Setting. The study setting was metropolitan Maiduguri, Nigeria. Subjects. Nigerian adults (n = 1411) were randomly selected from diverse neighborhoods and had complete data (43.1 % women, 33.8% overweight or obese). Measures. PA, sedentary time, and 16 perceived neighborhood environmental factors were measured using Nigerian adaptations of validated international questionnaires. Outcomes were measured BMI and interviewer-led self-reports of moderate to vigorous PA, walking, total PA, and sitting time. Analysis. The product-of-coefficient test using generalized linear models was used to assess the mediating effects of outcomes on the associations between environmental factors and BMI. Results. Walking and total PA significantly mediated the association between BMJ and perception of higher residential density (αβ = -.025 and -.037, respectively), absence of garbage (αβ = -.046 and -. 076, respectively), and more safety from crime at night (αβ = -.044 and -.083, respectively). In addition, walking, moderate to vigorous PA, and total PA significantly mediated the association between BMJ and perception of better aesthetics (αβ = -.035, -.022, and -.071, respectively). Sedentary time was not a significant mediator of any associations between environmental factors and BMI. Conclusion. The association of several neighborhood environmental variables with BMI was partially mediated hy PA in Nigerian adults. Including questions on specific types of sedentary behaviors in future prospective studies may improve understanding of the relative influence of sedentary behavior and physical activity on obesity control and prevention among sub-Saharan African adults.

AB- Purpose. To examine the effects of a Tai Chi Chung (TCC) program, an efficiency approach, on anxiety and cardiovascular risk factors. Design. A quasi-experimental study Setting. A community in Taipei City, Taiwan. Subjects. One hundred thirty-three adults aged 55 years and older. Intervention. Sixty-four participants (experimental group) attended a 60-minute Tai Chi exercise three times per week for 12 weeks, whereas 69 participants (control group) maintained their usual daily activities. Measures. Anxiety states, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks into the experiment, and 12 weeks into tile experiment. Analysis. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the changes. Results. Participants showed a greater drop in anxiety levels (β = -2.57, p = .001) and DBP (β = -7.02, p < .001) at the 12-week follow-up than did the controls. SBP sign~ficantly decreased in the 6-week follow-up and 12-week follow-up tests. The participants in the intervention achieved a greater drop in BMJ at the 6-week and 12-week follow-up visits than the controls. The interventions demonstrated decreased average WC at the 6-week and 12-week follow-up visits as compared to the controls. Conclusion. The results highlight the long-term benefits of a TCC program in facilitating health promotion by reducing anxiety and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine cross-sectional associations between vigorous physical activity, mental health, perceived stress, and socializing among 4-year college students. Design. A national cross-sectional sample of 4-year colleges in the United States. Setting. Ninety-four 4-year colleges in the United States. Subjects. A total of 14,804 undergraduate students. Measures. Self-report vigorous physical activity, perceived stress (measured using the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale), mental health (measured using the SF-36), and socializing (assessed using self-report number offriends and hours spent socializing). Analysis. Logistic regression models accounting for clustering within schools were estimated to examine the association between vigorous physical activity, mental health, perceived stress, and socializing. Adjusted models included high school vigorous physical activity and sociodemographic characteristics. Results. Students who met vigorous physical activity recommendations were less likely to report poor mental health (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: . 79 95% confidence interval [CI]: .69, .90) and perceived stress (adjusted OR. . 75; 95% CI: .67, .83) than students who did not meet recommendations. In addition, socializing partially mediated the relationship between vigorous physical activity, mental health, and perceived stress; however, race and sex did not moderate the relationship. Conclusion. Interventions aiming to improve mental well-being of college students should also consider promoting physical activity. At least some of the positive benefits of physical activity may arise from social interactions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Child and adolescent obesity is increasingly prevalent and predisposes risk for poor physical and psychosocial health. Physical and social factors in the environment, such as neighborhood disorder, may be associated with childhood obesity. This study examines the association between living in a disordered neighborhood and being overweight among a sample of urban schoolchildren. Design. Baseline interview data, including height, weight, and hip circumference, were obtained from 313 elementary school-aged participants in a community-based epidemiologic study. Setting. The setting was Baltimore, Maryland, a large metropolitan city Subjects. Subjects were elementary school students ages 8 to 12 years. Measures. To assess neighborhood characteristics, independent evaluators conducted objective environmental assessments using the Neighborhood Inventory for Environmental Typology instrument on the block faces (defined as one side of a city block between two intersections) where the children resided. Analysis. Logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between neighborhood disorder and children being overweight. Results. Neighborhood disorder showed a trend toward a statistically significant association with being overweight during childhood (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; confidence interval [CI], 99-1.07; p= .07) in the unadjusted model. Gender was significantly associated with being ovenveight, with female gender increasing the odds of being overweight by 50% in the sample (OR, 1.50; CI, 1.18-1.92; p < .01). After controlling for race, age, and comparative time spent on a sport, multivariable analyses revealed that gender (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.42; CI, 1.63-3.5 9; p < .01) and neighborhood disorder (AOR, 1.09; CI, 1.03-1.15;p < .01) were associated with being overweight. Further, an examination of interactions revealed girls (AOR, 2.40; CI, 1.65-3.4 9; p < .01) were more like/v to be overweight compared with boys (AOR, 2.20; CI, 1.57- 3.11; p < .01) living in neighborhoods with the same level of neighborhood disorder Conclusion. Results suggest neighborhood hazards warrant additional consideration for their potential as obesogenic elements affecting gender-based disparities in weight among urban schoolchildren. Future studies in this area should include longitudinal examinations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Few studies have assessed how attributes of neighborhood environments contribute to sedentary, in addition to active, behaviors. This study investigated associations of perceived social and physical aspects of neighborhood environments with television (TV) viewing and physical activity (PA) in African-American adults. Design. Gross-sectional an analysis of self-reported survey Setting. Large mega-church in. Houston, Texas. Subjects. A total of 1374 African-American men and women. Measures. Outcomes included log-transformed daily TV viewing and participation in medium/high levels of PA, measured by the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Neighborhood perceptions were assessed with the Social Cohesion and Trust and the Neighborhood Problems scales. Analysis. Multivariable models that controlled for clustering within neighborhoods. Results. Reporting more neighborhood problems was significantly associated with greater log- transformed TV viewing in women (β = .017, SE = .006, p = .003), and social cohesion was positively associated with PA in women (odds ratio = 1.06, 95% confidence interval = 1.02, 1.11, p = .006). Concerns about litter and walking after dark and a lack of places to shop were associated with increased TV viewing among women, and concerns about traffic and walking after dark were associated with reduced PA among men. Conclusion. Physical and social neighborhood conditions were associated with TV viewing and PA, particularly in women. Neighborhood-based strategies to reduce sedentary behaviors and enhance PA should include attention to social as well as physical aspects of neighborhood environments. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study examines worksite health promotion (WHP) and occupational health and safety (OHS) activities by Massachusetts employers, and the extent to which workplaces with programming in one domain were more likely to have the other as well. Design. In 2008, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health surveyed a stratified sample of Massachusetts worksites. Setting. A mailed questionnaire to be completed by workplace representatives. Subjects. Massachusetts worksites returning the questionnaire. Measures. Questionnaire items about worksite characteristics, WHP, and some OHS practices. Analysis. We scored levels of WHP and OHS activity; examined the relationship between activities in the two domains by employer characteristics; and assessed self-reported coordination between them. Results. The 890 responding worksites had higher scores for OHS (mean = 48% of practices, SD = 24%) than WHP (mean = 20%, SD = 12%). The difference between these scores varied by a factor of two across industry sectors and was smallest for workforces of 100+ employees (p = .001). Employers with no unionized workers reported fewer activities in both domains (p < .0001). Only 28% of respondents reported always/often coordinating OHS and WHP efforts; these organizations had more activities overall in both domains. Conclusion. Larger and unionized workplaces in Massachusetts were more likely to offer both WHP and OHS programming. Self-reported coordination was somewhat associated with more activity in both domains, although levels of WHP activity varied widely. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. An understanding of each racial/ethnic group's beliefs about cancer prevention is important for designing/implementing interventions to reduce cancer-health disparities. The Health Belief Model was used to examine racial/ethnic differences in beliefs about cancer and cancer prevention. Design. The data were from the 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey, a biennial, cross-sectional survey using a random-digit-dial telephone frame and a mailing address frame. Setting. A weighted, nationally representative sample of American adults. Subjects. The sample consisted of 7452 individuals. Measures. Model construct variables (perceived susceptibility; perceived severity; perceived benefits; perceived barriers; cues to action; self-efficacy) and race/ethnicity were assessed. Analysis. The Rao-Scott χ² test and multivariate logistic regression assessed racial/ethnic differences. Results. The constructs self-efficacy, perceived benefits, and perceived susceptibility were significantly associated with race/ethnicity. The remaining three constructs were not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis revealed Hispanics were less likely to believe they could lower their chances of getting cancer than did African-Americans and whites. Hispanics, Asians, and African-Americans were more likely to believe they had a lower chance of getting cancer in the future than did whites. Conclusion. Culturally relevant health education/promotion interventions need to be developed and tailored to (1) empower Hispanics regarding their ability to prevent cancer and (2) educate racial/ethnic minorities about their susceptibility and risk perception for cancer.

AB- Purpose. To ascertain the effectiveness of a behavior-change weight management program offered to teachers and state employees in North Carolina (NC). Design. Fifteen-week weight management program with premeasures and postmeasures. Setting. State agencies and public K-12 schools in five NC counties. Subjects. A total of 2574 NC state employees enrolled in 141 classes. Intervention. Eat Smart, Move More, Weigh Less (ESMMWL) is a 15-week weight management program delivered by trained instructors. Lessons inform, empower, and motivate participants to live mindfully as they make choices about eating and physical activity. Measures. Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, confidence in ability to eat healthy and be physically active, changes in eating, and physical activity behaviors. Analysis. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, χ²) tests, and analyses of variance. Results. Data are reported for 1341 participants in ESMMWL who completed the program, submitted an evaluation, and had not participated in the program in the past; 89% were female and mean age was 48.8 years. Average BMI and waist circumference decreased significantly. Confidence in eating healthfully and being physically active increased significantly. The percentage of participants with a BMI < 30 kg/m²) increased from 40% to 45% and those with a normal blood pressure increased from 23% to 32.5%. Participants reported being more mindful of what and how much they ate (92%), being more mindful of how much daily physical activity they got (88%), and eating fewer calories (87.3%). Conclusion. This project demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a behavior change-based weight management program at the worksite to achieve positive outcomes related to weight, blood pressure, healthy eating, and physical activity behaviors. Programs such as this have the potential to provide health care cost savings. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the role of perceived significant other's modeling or encouragement of dieting in young adults' disordered eating behaviors. Design. Online survey data were collected (2008-2009) as part of an ongoing study examining weight and related issues in young people. Setting. Participants were originally recruited as students at middle and high schools in Minnesota (1998-1999). Subjects. One thousand two hundred ninety-four young adults (mean age 25.3, 55% female, 50% white) with significant others. Measures. Participants were asked if their significant other diets or encourages them to diet. Behaviors included unhealthy weight control, extreme weight control, and binge eating. Analysis. General linear models estimated the predicted probability of using each behavior across levels of significant other's dieting or encouraging dieting, stratifying by gender, and adjusting for demographics and body mass index. Results. Perceived dieting and encouragement to diet by significant others were common. Disordered eating behaviors were positively associated with significant other's dieting and encouragement to diet, particularly for females. In models including both perceived dieting and encouragement, encouragement remained significantly associated with disordered eating. For example, women's binge eating was almost doubled if their significant other encouraged dieting "very much" (25.5%) compared to "not at all" (13.6%, p = .015). Conclusion. There is a strong association between disordered eating behaviors and perceived modeling and encouragement to diet by significant others in young adulthood. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the impact of media literacy for tobacco prevention for youth delivered through a community site. Design. A randomized pretest-posttest evaluation design with matched-contact treatment and control conditions. Setting. The pilot study was delivered through the YMCA in a lower-income suburban and rural area of Southwest Virginia, a region long tied, both economically and culturally, to the tobacco industry. Subjects. Children ages 8 to 14 (76% white, 58% female) participated in the study (n = 38). Intervention. The intervention was an antismoking media literacy program (five 1-hour lessons) compared with a matched-contact creative writing control program. Measures. General media literacy, three domains of tobacco-specific media literacy ("authors and audiences," "messages and meanings," and "representation and reality"), tobacco attitudes, and future expectations were assessed. Analysis. Multiple regression modeling assessed the impact of the intervention, controlling for pretest measures, age, and sex. Results. General media literacy and tobacco-specific "authors and audiences" media literacy improved significantly for treatment compared with control (p < .05); results for other tobacco-specific media literacy measures and for tobacco attitudes were not significant. Future expectations of smoking increased significantly for treatment participants ages 10 and younger (p < .05). Conclusion. Mixed results indicated that improvements in media literacy are accompanied by an increase in future expectations to smoke for younger children. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To explore differences and similarities in environmental, personal, and behavioral factors influencing eating behavior among low-income women of varying weight status. Design. Focus groups (n = 16) were used to collect qualitative data. Quantitative data collected included demographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric (heights and weights). Setting. Community centers, libraries, and homeless shelters in low-income neighborhoods. Participants. Of the 83 participants, 58% were African-American, 28% were white, and the remainder were American Indian, Hispanic, or mixed race. A total of 35% of participants were lean/normal (body mass index <25 kg/m²) and 65% were overweight/obese (body mass index >25 kg/m²). Method. Focus group methodology was used to collect data on 83 participants. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) provided the theoretical basis. Transcripts were analyzed using the open-coding method and comments between lean/normal and overweight/obese women were systematically compared. Results. Focus group themes were food environment, aberrant eating behavior, health values, and beliefs. Differences in personal and behavioral factors were apparent between overweight/obese and lean/normal women, with the former group frequently discussing emotional eating, overeating, and stashing food, and the latter group communicating greater nutrition knowledge and describing regular physical activity. Both groups similarly expressed experiences with food insecurity and lived in low-income environments. Conclusion. For low-income women, personal and behavioral factors may modify the influence of their obesogenic food environment. Further research within the context of SCT should examine differences between lean/normal and overweight/obese women living in the same environment. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine whether Transtheoretical Model (TTM) constructs differ between individuals making successful versus unsuccessful stage transitions for consumption of five or more servings of fruit and vegetables each day and thus provide a useful basis for designing health promotion interventions. Design. Longitudinal, observational study. A randomly selected, multiethnic cohort of adults assessed at 6-month intervals over 2 years. Setting. General community, Hawaii. Subjects. There were 700 participants (62.6% female; mean = 47 ± 17.1 years; 31.1% Asian, 22.1% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 35.0% Caucasian; 25.1% participation rate). Measures. Stage of readiness, experiential and behavioral processes of change, pros, cons, self-efficacy, and self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption. Analysis. The study used t-tests to determine which TTM variable scores differed consistently between those making "successful" versus "unsuccessful?" stage transitions from precontemplation, preparation, and maintenance. Sample sizes for contemplation and action prohibited similar analyses. Results. Compared to those remaining in precontemplation, individuals successfully progressing from precontemplation showed significantly greater use of behavioral processes (collectively and self-liberation) and consciousness raising (p < .001). However, only self-liberation demonstrated significant differences consistently over time. Conclusion. This longitudinal investigation reveals that TTM behavioral processes, particularly self-liberation, predict successful transition out of precontemplation for adult fruit and vegetable consumption, suggesting that public health messages tailored according to these TTM variables may be effective for this group. However, for adults prepared to adopt or maintain fruit and vegetable consumption, tailoring based on variables from other theories is needed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. To conduct a systematic review to assess recruitment rates in workplace physical activity (PA) intervention studies and describe characteristics of studies with high recruitment rates. Data Source. Electronic and manual searches were conducted. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Workplace PA intervention studies that reported the number of employees invited to participate and the number who responded were included. Data Extraction. Studies with recruitment rates of ≥ 70% were categorized as high with the remaining studies (< 70%) used as comparison. Key study characteristics were assessed. Data Synthesis. An approach called positive deviance was used to identify the extent to which study characteristics were unique to high recruitment rate. Results. Seventy-six percent of studies failed to report recruitment rates (n= 30 included for review). Studies with high recruitment rates (n = 8) tended to have longer study duration (mean 1.6 years) and target smaller cohorts of employees (mean n = 199) than comparison studies (3.9 months; n = 1241). For recruitment strategies and intervention components of high studies, involvement of employees was driven by the organization, with PA interventions provided as part of the working day in paid time. Conclusion. These findings suggest a potential to improve recruitment through targeting small cohorts of employees, incorporating PA as a long-term strategy, facilitating organizationally driven employee involvement, and providing PA interventions during paid time.

AB- Purpose. To investigate the health needs of a rapidly growing Latino community and understand priorities for developing culturally sensitive health promotion strategies. Approach. A participatory research approach was selected to understand health challenges and opportunities for health engagement in the community. Setting. Norwood, Ohio, a small community in southwest Ohio. Participants. Latino adults living, working, or accessing services in Norroood. Method. Trained community researchers collected survey data from 7 98 participants at multiple community "points of contact" and door-to-door in more isolated neighborhoods. Survey data were aggregated using descriptive statistics. Two focus groups were conducted with 25 community members, transcribed, and analyzed using principles of thematic analysis. Participants' health concerns, health behaviors, and access to/expediences with health care were assessed. Results, findings indicated significant health concerns, including overweight (43.2%) and obesity (28.6%), mental health challenges (anxiety 15.7%; depression 15.0%), and oral health concerns (23.0%). In addition, community members described barriers to accessing health care and strategies for preventing health problems and promoting positive health. Participants also discussed perceived discrimination and the need to address isolation within their community. Conclusion. Methods and findings from the ¡Hazlo Bien! participatory needs assessment are likely to be useful to those designing health promotion programs in quickly growing Latino communities where there are limited health services and few existing social support networks.

AB- Purpose. To examine if adults and adolescents living in the same high- and low-walkable neighborhoods have different environmental perceptions and if this is reflected in distinct associations between environmental perceptions and active transportation. Design. Cross-sectional study with observational design. Setting. In Ghent, 24 neighborhoods were selected, stratified on objectively assessed walkability, and matched on neighborhood income. This resulted in four walkability/income quadrants, each consisting of six neighborhoods. Subjects. Living in the 24 neighborhoods were 1166 adults (20-65 years, 52.1 % women) and 477 adolescents 13-15 years, 49.7% girls). Measures. All participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the International (adults) or Flemish (adclescents) Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Neigldjorhood Environmental Walkability Scale. Analysis. Multilevel (two-level: participant-neighborhood) moderated regression models, using MLwiN 2.23. Results. Both adults and adolescents living in objectively high-walkable neighborhoods perceived their environment as more activity friendly than their loio-walkable neighborhoods cmmlerparts (11 out of 13 main effects walkability: p < .05). However, perceived residential density (p < .05), land use mix (p < . 01), safety for cycling (p < . 05), and perceived walkability (p < . 001) loere associated with active transportation only in adults. Conclusion. Different environmental intervention strategies are probably needed to increase active transportation in Belgian adults and adolescents living in the same neighborhoods. In adults, changing objective or perceived environmental characteristics might be effective, whereas in adolescents, the current environmental focus should be changed towards multidimensional research.

AB- Purpose. Examine the effects of an interactive environmental intervention on stair usage. Design. A nonrandomized, quasi-experimental intervention. Setting. Two three-story office buildings. Subjects. Approximately 200 employees at the intervention site and 140 at the comparison site. Intervention. The stairwell was decorated with interactive paintings such as maps, storyboards, and wish lists to encourage employees to take the stairs rather than the elevator. Measures. Daily stair and elevator usage were measured using electronic sensors or door-access card counters for 2 weeks prior to the intervention and 6 weeks after. Analysis. The daily counts of stair use were modeled using a Poisson regression to estimate the effect of the intervention on staircase use. Results. At baseline, the mean proportion of stair use relative to stair plus elevator use at the intervention site was 31.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.3%-32.7%). During the 6-weeks intervention period, this proportion increased significantly to 66.2 % (95 % CI, 64.4 %-67.9%). There was no significant change in stair use at the comparison site. In a Poisson regression of the daily number of stair users, the incidence rate ratio associated with the intervention was 2.57 (95% CI, 235-2.82). Conclusion. This interactive environmental intervention increased stair usage in an office setting relative to the comparison site, and this increase was sustained over a 6-week period. Adding interactive components to motivational or environmental change interventions shows promise in increasing stair usage. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. There is limited documentation regarding the potential quality of life (QOL) benefits associated with use of a worksite wellness center. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between potential QOL change and use of a worksite wellness center during a 12-month period. Design. Analysis of an annual QOL wellness center member survey and wellness center use during a 12-month time period. Setting. A worksite wellness center. Participants. A total of 1151 employee wellness center members, average age of 39.5 years, 69.7% female, and 43.5% reported being overweight. Intervention. Members of the worksite wellness center have access to a range of fitness options, including exercise classes, water aerobics, an indoor track, strength training, and aerobic conditioning equipment. Additionally, nutritional classes are offered, and there is a wellness cafe. For resiliency, members can participate in wellness coaching or a stress-reduction group program. Method. Participants completed a baseline QOL survey and a second QOL survey 1 year later. An electronic entry system tracked use of the wellness center. Results. Participants were divided into four wellness center use quartiles: low users (less than once every 2 weeks), below-average users, above-average users, and high users (two to three visits per week). High users reported experiencing improvements in their physical QOL (p < .0001) compared with the low users. Additionally low users experienced a greater decline in their mental QOL (p= .05) compared loith high users. Conclusion. In a large sample of employees, use of a wellness center during a 12-month period was associated with benefits for physical QOL. QOL is an important domain of wellness; therefore, in addition to measuring physiologic changes, examining potential QOL changes may be another important outcome measure for wellness centers.

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this paper is to describe the health benefits reported by breast cancer survivors following an 8-week yoga intervention-Design. This phenomenological study employed three focus groups with six breast cancer survivors each (n - 18) following the yoga intervention. Setting. The focus groups and yoga classes were conducted in a large hospital in a midsized town in the Midwest. Subjects. Eighteen female breast cancer survivors who were at least 9 months posttreatment participated in the focus groups following the 8-week yoga intervention. Intervention. An 8-ioeek yoga intervention designed specifically for this population was led by a yoga therapist. Measures. A semistructured interview guide was utilized to guide each focus group. Analysis. Interpretative phenomenological analysis methods were employed to explore breast cancer survivors' experiences after participating in an 8-week yoga intervention. Results. The findings revealed that the women in the study found health promoting benefits in the areas of physical health and healing, mental health and healing, and social health and healing. Conclusions. Yoga may be an important tool in the healing process for breast cancer survivors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Women younger than 25 years are at greatest risk for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, including high-risk strains associated with 70% of cervical cancers. Effective model-based measures that can lead to intervention development to increase HPV vaccination rates are necessary. This study validated Transtheoretical Model measures of Decisional Balance and Self Efficacy for seeking the HPV vaccine in a sample of female college students. Design. Cross-sectional measurement development. Setting. Online survey of undergraduate college students. Subjects. A total of 340 female students ages 18 to 26 years. Measures. Stage of Change, Decisional Balance, and Self-Efficacy. Analysis. The sample was randomly split into halves for exploratory principal components analyses (PCAs), followed by confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to test measurement models. Multivariate analyses examined relationships between constructs. Results. For Decisional Balance, PCA indicated two 4-item factors (Pros-α = . 90; and Cons-α. = .66). CFA supported a two-factor correlated model, X2(19) = 39.33; p < .01; comparative jit index (CFI) =. 97; and average absolute standardized residual statistic (AASR) =. 03; with Pros α = .90 and Cons α = .67. For Self-Efficacy, PCA indicated one 6-item factor (α = .84). CFA supported this structure, X2(9) = 50.87; p< .05; CFI= .94; AASR= .03; and α= .90. Multivariate analyses indicated significant cross-stage differences on Pros, Cons, and Self-Efficacy in expected directions. Conclusion. Findings support the internal and external validity of these measures and their use in Transtheoretical Model-tailored interventions. Stage-construct relationships suggest that reducing the Cons of vaccination may be more important for HPV than for behaviors with a true Maintenance stage. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine the associations of daily pedometer steps with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychosocial health. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. Alberta, Canada. Subjects. Three hundred eighty-five older-aged men 55 years of age and older. Measures. Subjects completed a mailed survey that assessed HRQoL (RAND-12 Health Status Inventory [RAND-12]), depression, anxiety, and satisfaction with life. Steps/day were assessed with a pedometer via a 3-day step-monitoring period. Analysis. Average pedometer steps/d were categorized into quartiles (Qs). The primary model assessed the association between average pedometer steps/d as the independent variable of interest and our dependent variables of interest (physical, mental, and global health component scores of the RAND-12). Results. For HRQoL, all three adjusted models (i.e., physical, mental, and global health) indicated a significant linear trend between HRQoL indices across pedometer step Qs, with participants in Q3 and Q4 demonstrating higher physical, mental, and global health compared to participants in the lowest Qojpedometer steps (Q1) (allp < .05). For depression, significant differences were observed between Q1 and Q3 (Mdiff= 3.3, p = .006, n2= .019) and Ql and Q4 (Mdiff= 2.7, p= .025, η2=.013). Conclusion. Higher average steps/d were significantly associated with HRQoL across all domains. Older men in the higher Qs of pedometer steps/d reported less depressive symptoms compared to those in the lowest Q of pedometer steps/d. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Drawing from self-determination theory, this study investigated adults' perceptions of the process of long-term maintenance of physical activity and how it may relate to their self-identity. Design. Qualitative study included 22 in-depth interviews and participants' recorded personal reflective journals. Setting. Health/fitness facility in a Midwestern city. Participants. Purposeful sample of 12 adult (age range 29-73 years) members who had engaged in regular physical activity for at least 3 years. Methods. Data were collected on participants' perceptions of processes associated with physical activity maintenance. Grounded theory data analysis techniques were used to develop an understanding of participants' long-term physical activity adherence. Results. Analysis revealed three themes organized around basic psychological need satisfaction: (1) Relatedness included receiving and giving support. (2) Competence included challenge and competition, managing weight, and strategies for health management. (3) Autonomy included confidence in the established routine, valuing fitness status, and feeling self-directed. The final theme of physically active self included the personal fit of an active lifestyle, identity as an active person, and attachment to physical activity as life enhancing. Conclusion. Our results suggest that long-term physical activity adherence may be strengthened by promotion of the individuals basic psychological need satisfaction. Adherence is most likely to occur when the value of participation becomes internalized over time as a component of the physically active self. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To evaluate the ethnic differences in the home physical activity and screen time environment of preschoolers enrolled in Head Start. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. Sixteen Harris County Department ofEducation (HCDE) Head Start centers, Texas. Subjects. Seven hundred and six preschoolers enrolled in HCDE Head Start centers and their parents. Measures. Items from the parent-reported Healthy Home Survey evaluating the home physical activity environment and the Nutrition Screening form evaluating screen time. Analysis. Mixed model linear and logistic regression analysis. Results. Of the parents, 75.06% were overweight or obese. Hispanic parents were more likely to have a yard or open space (p = .014) and usable play equipment in the yard (p = .019) for their children to play in compared to African-Americans. Conversely, more African-American parents reported having a television (TV) in their preschooler's bedroom (p = .032) and were less likely to cut down their child's TV viewing time (p = .036). African-American preschoolers were reportedly more likely to eat while watching TV (p = .009), play video games for ≥2 hours on weekdays (p = .018) and have computer time for ≥2 hours on weekende (p = .007), compared to Hispanics. Conclusion. The Hispanic participants of this study had a healthier home environment for physical activity and screen time as compared with their African-American counterparts. Future interventions targeting lifestyle change need to address these factors in an ethnic-specific manner. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine whether body mass index (BMI) is associated with proximity to neighborhood paths, the size of the paths, their cleanliness, and the availability of recreational facilities in the paths. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. New York City. Subjects. Adults (13,102) were recruited from 2000 to 2002 (median age 45 years, 36% male). Measures. Anthropometric and sociodemographic data from study subjects were linked to Department of Parks & Recreation data on park space, cleanliness, and facilities. Neighborhood-level sociodemographic and park proximity metrics were created for half-mile-radius circular buffers around each subject's residence. Proximity to park space was measured as the proportion of the subject's neighborhood buffer area that was total park space, large park space (a park >6 acres) and small park space (a park ⩽ 6 acres). Analysis. Hierarchical linear models were used to determine whether neighborhood park metrics were associated with BMI. Results. Higher proximity to large park space was significantly associated with lower BMI (beta = - 1.69, 95% confidence interval = -2.76, - .63). Across the population distribution of proximity to large park space, compared to subjects living in neighborhoods at the 10th percentile of the distribution, the covariate-adjusted average BMJ was estimated to be .35 kg/m2 lower for those living in neighborhoods at the 90th percentile. The proportion of neighborhood area that was small park space was not associated with BMI, nor was park cleanliness or the availability of recreational facilities. Conclusion. Neighborhood proximity to large park spaces is modestly associated with lower BMI in a diverse urban population. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine the feasibility of a community-wide approach integrated with primary care (Cardiovascular Health Awareness Program [CHAP]) to promote monitoring of blood pressure (1W) and awareness of cardiovascular disease risk. Design. Demonstration project. Setting. Two midsized Ontario communities. Participants. Community-dwelling seniors. Intervention. CHAP sessions were offered in pharmacies and promoted to seniors using advertising and personalized letters from physicians. Trained volunteers measured 1W, completed risk profiles, and provided risk- specific education materials. Method. We examined the distribution of risk factors among participants and predictors of multiple visits and elevated BP. Results. Opinion leaders aided recruitment of family physicians (n = 56/63) and pharmacists (n = 18/19). Over 90 volunteers were recruited. Invitations were mailed to 4394 seniors. Over 10 weeks, there were 4165 assessments of 2350 unique participants (approximately 30% of senior residents). 37.5% of attendees had untreated (16%; 360/2247) or uncontrolled (21.5%; 482/2247) high BP. Participants who received a letter (odds ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-3.0), had an initial elevated BP (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5), or reported current antihypertensive medication (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.6) were more likely to attend multiple sessions (p ⩽ .05 for all). Older age (≥ 70 years; OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.8), BMI ≥ 30 (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-2.2), current antihypertensive medication (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-1.9), and diabetes (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.9-3.2) predicted elevated BP (p <.001 for all). Conclusion. The program yielded learning about community mobilization anti identified a substantial number of seniors with undiagnosed/uncontrolled high BP. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The study aim was to determine the utility of and satisfaction with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Web-based employer tool, CDC's LEAN Works!, which provides evidence-based recommendations and promising practices for obesity prevention and control at worksites. Design. This study examined employers 'natural usage (i.e., without any study parameters on how, when, or how much to use the Web site and its resources) and impressions of the Web site. Setting. Employers of varying sizes, industry types, and levels of maturity in offering obesity management programs and from both private and public sectors were recruited to participate in the study. Participants. A convenience sample of 29 employers enrolled to participate. Method. Participants were followed over a 12-month period. First impressions, bimonthly use of the Web site, and final assessments were collected using self-report surveys and individual interviews. Descriptive analyses were conducted. Results. Alnwst all (96%) ofparticipants reported a positive experience with the Web site noting it provided a wealth of information. Most reported they planned to continue to use the Web site to develop (77%), implement (92%), and evaluate (85%) their obesity management programs. Aspects of the Web site that employers found valuable included a step-by-step implementation process, templates and toolkits, specific recommendations, and promising practices. Concluxion. CDC's LEAN Works! is a useful resourcefor employees wishing to develop and implement evidence-based workplace obesity prevention programs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Family-skills training programs prevent adolescent substance use, but few exist for immigrant Latino families. This study assesses the feasiliility of a family-skills training intervention developed using a community-based participatory research framework, and explores parental traditional values as a modifier of preliminary effects. Design. One-group pretest-posttest. Setting. Four Latino youth-serving sites (school, clinic, church, social-service agency). Subjects. Immigrant Latino parents of adolescents aged 10 to 14 years (N = 83). Intervention. Eight-session program in Spanish to improve parenting pra ctices and parent-youth interpersonal relations designed with Latino parents and stafffrom collaborating organizations. Measures. Feasibility was assessed through retention, program appropriateness, and group interaction quality. Preliminary outcomes evaluated were (1) parenting self-efficacy, discipline, harsh parenting, monitoring, conflict, attachment, acceptance, and involvement, and (2) parent perception of adolescent internalizing, externalizing, and substance use behaviors. Covariates included sociodemographics and parental endorsement of traditional values. Analysis. Feasibility outcomes were assessed with descriptive statistics. Paired t-tests measured changes in parenting outcomes. Adjusted multiple regression models were conducted for change in each outcome, and t-tests compared mean changes in outcomes between parents with high and low traditional values scores. Results. Program appropriateness and group interaction scores were positive. Improvement was noted for eight parenting outcomes. Parents perceived that adolescent internalizing behaviors decreased. Parents with lower endorsement of traditional values showed greater pretest.posttest change in attachment, acceptance, and involvement. Conclusion. This intervention is feasible and may influence parenting contributors to adolescent substance use. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To empirically investigate the relationship of social interactions with self-rated health status. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. The United States, 1972-2008. Subjects. 53,043 respondents interviewed. Measures. In-person interviews were conducted by the National Opinion Research Center. Health is measured via self-assessment, and a binary indicator defines whether the respondent reports excellent or good health. Impersonal social interaction is binary, reflecting membership in at least one organization; personal interaction is binary, reflecting whether the respondent visits relatives, neighbors, friends, or bars at least once a month. Demographic, region, and time variables are standard controls. Analysis. Probit model.s were estimated at aggregated and disaggregated (race, gender, age, and education) levels. Results. Impersonal interaction fell 5% between 1974 and 1994, with deeper declines (12%) in personal interaction. Neighbor visits fell most (24 %), but friends gained (5%). Marginal estimates indicate both personal and impersonal interactions are associated with better health. However, friends show the strongest effect. A 1-SD increase in the probability of meeting fri ends versus joining a club or association is associated with a higher (.019 vs. .014) probability of being in very good or excellent health. Conclusion. Social interaction, impersonal or personal is significantly associated with health. Public policy facilitating greater interactions of the type that benefits different demographic groups may be health promoting. Results are suggestive ofpotential network effects at the individual and community levels, which have implications for designing and targeting more effective health interventions.

AB- Purpose. The study uses qualitative research to gain a better understanding of what occurs after low-income women receive an abnormal breast screening and the factors that influence their decisions and behavior. A heuristic model is presented for understanding this complexity. Design. Qualitative research methods used to elicited social and cultural themes related to breast cancer screening follow-up. Setting. Individual telephone interviews were conducted with 16 women with confirmed breast anomaly Participants. Low-income women screened through a national breast cancer early detection program. Method. Grounded theory using selective coding was employed to elicit factors that influenced the understanding and follow-up of an abnormal breast screening result. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and uploaded into NVivo 8, a qualitative management and analysis software package. Results. For women (16, or 72% of case management referrals) below 250% of the poverty level the impact of social and economic inequities creates a psychosocial context underlined by structural and cultural barriers to treatment that forecasts the mechanism that generates differences in health outcomes. The absence of insurance due to underemployment and unemployment and inadequate public infrastructure intensified emotional stress impacting participants' health decisions. Conclusion. The findings that emerged offer explanations of how consistent patterns of social injustice impact treatment decisions in a high-risk vulnerable population that have implications for health promotion research and systems-level program improvement and development.

AB- Purpose. To examine the relationship between physical activity stages of change and preferences for financial risk and time. Design. A cross-sectional, community-based study Setting. A low-income, urban, African-American neighborhood. Subjects. One hundred sixty-nine adults. Measures. Self-reported physical activity stages of change—precontemplation to maintenance, objectively measured body mass index and waist circumference, and economic preferences for time and risk measured via incentivized economic experiments. Analysis. Multivariable ordered logistic regression models were used to examine the association between physical activity stages of change and economic preferences while controlling for demographic characteristics of the individuals. Results. Individuals who are more tolerant offinancial risks (odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, p < .05) and whose time preferences indicate more patience (OR= 1.68, p < .01) are more likely to be in a more advanced physical activity stage (e.g., from preparation to action). The likelihood of being in the maintenance stage increases by 5.6 and 10.9 percentage points for each one-unit increase in financial risk tolerance or one-unit increase in the time preference measure, respectively. Conclusion. Greater tolerance offinancial risk and more patient time preferences among this low-income ethnic minority population are associated with a more advanced physical activity stage. Further exploration is clearly warranted in larger and more representative samples. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. An employee wellness program was evaluated to assess changes in germ transmission, absenteeism, and cost of infection-related illness among office-based employees. Design. One-group pretestfosttest design, with intervention delivered for 90 days and measurement conducted over 1 year. Setting. Employees of a large office space in Georgia. Subjects. One thousand six hundred forty-five employees. Intervention. The Healthy Workplace Project is a 90-day wellness program aimed to increase health and productivity of employees through educational and engagement activities focusing on improving awareness, recognizing infection-related illnesses, and reducing the spread of germs in the workplace. Measures. Three types of data were collected: (1) bacterial audits through use of adenosine triphosphate monitoring of various work spaces; (2) self report absenteeism data using the World Health Organization's Health and Work Performance Questionnaire; and (3) participant employees' medical claims/costs of infection-related minor illnesses. Analysis. Frequencies and bacterial audit data; Wilcoxon signed ranks tests to determine changes in rates on absenteeism and health care costs. Results. Bacterial audits demonstrated a reduction in contamination levels of 33 % across all measured spaces. Absenteeism rates were reduced by 13%. Medical service utilization costs were not significantly reduced for individual employees over the project year. Conclusion. Educational strategies and individual monitoring of germ transmission appears effective in improving employees' health and decreasing absenteeism. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine the association between worksite social support and changes in diet, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI). Design. Cohort analysis of an underlying randomized, controlled, weight gain prevention worksite trial: Promoting Activity and Changes in Eating. Setting. The trial occurred in the greater Seattle area. Subjects. Baseline and follow-up data xoere obtained on a nested cohort of employees (n = 958-1078) from 33 small- to medium-sized worksites. Measures. Worksite social support, diet, physical activity, and BMI measures were assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Analysis. To adjust for multilevel data and multiple time points, we used generalized estimating equations and logistic mixed models. Results. Higher baseline worksite social support was associated with greater changes in fruit and vegetable intake (p = .001; summary food-frequency questions). Conclusion. This study does not support a conclusive relationship between worksite social support and health behavior change. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study tested the effectiveness of two point-of decision signs to increase stair use and investigated message content by comparing signs with general and specific messages. Design. This study used a quasi-experimental time series design, including a 2-week baseline period: 2 weeks with a general message and 2 weeks with a specific message. Setting. The signs were placed in an eight-story university building. Subjects. The subjects comprised all adults entering the building. During the study, 2991 observations of stair/elevator choice were made. Intervention. A stair-prompt sign with a general message and a sign with a specific message served as the interventions. Measures. Observers measured stair/elevator choice, demographics, and traffic volume. Analysis. Logistic regression analyses were employed, adjusting for covariates. Results. The specific sign intervention showed significantly increased odds of stair use compared to baseline (odds ratio [OR] = 2.04, 95% confidence interval [Cl] = 1.46-2.84). The odds of stair use were also significantly greater with the specific sign than the general sign (OR= 1.57, 95% CI= 1.13-2.20). Conclusion. Only the specific sign significantly increased stair use.

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this research was to examine the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the situational self-efficacy scale for vegetable and fruit consumption in adolescents. Design. This was a methodological study. Setting. The study was conducted in four public secondary schools in Istanbul, Turkey. Subjects. Subjects were 1586 adolescents. Measures. Content and construct validity were assessed to test the validity of the scale. The reliability was assessed in terms of internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Analysis. For confirmatory factor analysis, x2 statistics plus other fit indices were used, including the goodness-of-fit index, the adjusted goodness-of-fit index, the nonnormed fit index, the comparative fit index, the standardized root mean residual, and the root mean square error of approximation. Pearson’s correlation was used for test-retest reliability and item total correlation. The internal consistency was assessed by using Cronbach a. Results. Confirmatory factor analysis strongly supported the three-component structure representing positive social situations (α = .81), negative effect situations (α = .93), and difficult situations (α = .78). Psychometric analyses of the Turkish version of the situational self-efficacy scale indicate high reliability and good content and construct validity. Conclusion. Researchers and health professionals will fin d it useful to employ the Turkish situational self-efficacy scale in evaluating situational self-efficacy for fruit and vegetable consumption in Turkish adolescents.

AB- Purpose. Assessing the potential link between smoking behavior and exposure to mass media depictions of smoking on social networking Web sites. Design. A representative longitudinal panel of 200 young adults in Connecticut. Setting. Telephone surveys were conducted by using computer assisted telephone interviewing technology and electronic dialing for random digit dialing and listed samples. Subjects. Connecticut residents aged 18 to 24 years. Measures. To measure encoded exposure, respondents were asked whether or not they had smoked a cigarette in the past 30 days and about how often they had seen tobacco use on television, in movies, and in social media content. Respondents were also asked about cigarette use in the past 30 days, and a series of additional questions that have been shown to be predictive of tobacco use. Analysis. Logistic regression was used to test for our main prediction that reported exposure to social media tobacco depictions at time 1 would influence time 2 smoking behavior. Results. Encoded exposure to social media tobacco depictions (B = .47, p < .05) was a significant predictor of time 2 smoking, even after controlling for all the aforementioned predictors. Conclusion. Our results suggest that social media depictions of tobacco use predict future smoking tendency, over and above the influence of TV and movie depictions of smoking. This is the first known study to specifically assess the role o f social media in informing tobacco behavior. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- The increasingly popular practice of using a stability ball (exercise/fitness ball) as a sitting surface runs counter to conventional human factors/ergonomics guidelines for seated workspace design. Employees sitting on stability balls in an office environment present safety risks that might be justifiable if the practice has a definitive benefit to the promotion of health. However', the published studies and best evidence to date call into question even the theoretical basis for this practice and do not suggest significant health benefits. First, biomechanical studies do not confirm the intended trunk muscle activation. Second, energy expenditure studies show a small (if any) increase in metabolic demand that is unlikely to be effective in combating sedentary work risk factors. Until studies demonstrate more conclusive benefits, the practice of stability ball sitting should be viewed skeptically as a general workplace recommendation in the interest of health or wellness.

AB- Purpose. Smoking prevalence is alarmingly high among the homeless. Few studies have focused on predictors of smoking abstinence in this population. Subjective social status, a person’s ranking of their own social standing relative to others in the United States or in their own self-defined communities, has predicted smoking cessation among domiciled smokers in analyses adjusted for objective socioeconomic status and other demographic variables. This study examined if subjective social status predicted quit-day abstinence among homeless smokers making a quit attempt. Design. Longitudinal study using self-reported survey data. Setting. Transitional homeless shelter in Dallas, Texas. Subjects. A total of 57 homeless smokers enrolled in a cessation program. Measures. Predictors were the Subjective Social Status-U. S (SSS-U. S.) and the Subjective Social Status-Community (SSS-Community) ladders measured 1 week pre quit. Covariates were sociodemographics and tobacco dependence measured 1 week pre quit. The outcome was self-reported and biochemically verified smoking abstinence on the quit day. Analysis. Covariate-adjusted logistic regression models. Results. Higher rankings on the SSS-U. S. ladder, but not the SSS-Community ladder, predicted abstinence on the quit day (p = .005). Conclusion. Lower rankings on the SSS-U. S. ladder predicted increased risk of relapse on the quit day or the inability to quit at all. The SSS-U. S. ladder might be useful in identifying homeless smokers needing additional preparation and intervention before initiating a quit attempt. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Investigate the relationship between body mass and hip bone mineral density (BMD) and the extent to which this association is influenced by potential mediating factors. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. Approximately 20 cities in Utah and Wyoming. Subjects. Subjects were 262 apparently healthy, nonsmoking females. Measures. Hip BMD was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Physical activity (PA) was measured objectively using accelerometers. Calcium and vitamin D were measured using the Block food frequency questionnaire. Menopause status and bone drug use were measured using a questionnaire. Analysis. General linear models and partial correlations. Results. With body mass divided into three categories, hip BMD differed significantly across the groups in a dose-response manner: low mass (mean ± standard deviation [SD]), .876 ± .085 g/cm2; moderate, .932 ± .109g/cm2; and high mass, .995 ± .112 g/cm2 (F= 21.5, p < .0001). The relationship between mass and hip BMD was not affected by differences in age, height, menopause status, calcium or vitamin D intake, PA, or use of bone prescription drugs. Conclusion. These findings suggest that women with low body mass tend to have low hip BMD and those with high mass tend to have high BMD. Controlling for the potential mediating variables did not influence the dose-response relationship between mass and BMD. It appears that lifestyle may not influence the body mass and BMD relationship, making it a challenge for women with low mass to avoid risk of low BMD. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Eleven retirement communities. Subjects. Older adults ≥65 years (N= 353). Measures. Self-rated trust in health information sources. Analysis. Mann-Whitney U-test or Fisher exact test to compare trust between age groups; multinomial ordered logistic regression analyses to model trust in Internet information sources. Results. The overall survey response rate was 26.6%. Differences in trust were identified between oldest old (n= 108) and young/middle old (n= 245) for pharmacist (p < .05), Internet (p < .001), television (p < .05), radio (p < .001), and newspaper (p < .05) sources. In the oldest old, we found associations between levels of trust in Internet sources and frequency of Internet use (ß = 4.13, p < .001). Conclusion. Understanding where differences in trust arise can inform the design of resources to support the information-seeking process. When planning widespread distribution of health information to these distinct groups, program developers need to consider these differences. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study presents group (instructor-led) and self-directed (nongroup) participant achievement of exercise objectives and satisfaction with the Arthritis Foundation's Walk With Ease (WWE) program at 6 weeks postintervention and 1-year follow-up. Design. Secondary data analysis. Setting. Rural and urban counties in North Carolina. Subjects. Four hundred sixty-two adults with self-reported joint pain/stiffness or physician- diagnosed arthritis, age ≥18 years, no serious medical condition, no cognitive impairments, English speaking. Intervention. WWE is a 6-week community-based walking program offered in two formats- group and self-directed. Measures. Self-report measures collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 1 year. Analysis. Descriptive statistics, x2 and t-tests. Results. Individuals self-selected either group (n= 192) or self-directed (n= 270) format. On average, participants were age 67, Caucasian (70%), and female (88%). Mean minutes per walk increased from 16.7 at baseline to 34.2 minutes at 1 year among group participants, and from 16.5 to 33. 7 minutes among self-directed. At 1 year, 59.6% of group and 69.3% of self-directed participants reported continued walking (p = . 06). Group participants were more likely than self-directed to do recommended stretching (p < . 02) and warm-up/cool-down exercises (p < .01). Conclusion. Group and self-directed participants have similar self-reported walking outcomes but have some differences in their utilization of WWE recommendations. ( ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To understand how social and structural contexts shape individual risk, vulnerability, and interconception health-related behaviors of African-American women. Approach or Design. A longitudinal ethnographic study was conducted. Setting. The study was conducted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Participants. The sample included 19 African-American women who were participants in the intervention group of a randomized clinical trial of interconceptional care. Method. Data were collected through interaction with participants over a period of 6 to 12 months. Participant observation, structured and unstructured interviews, and Photovoice were used to obtain data; grounded theory was used for analysis. The analysis was guided by intersectional theory. Results. Social disadvantage influenced health and health care–seeking behaviors of African-American women, and the disadvantage centered on the experience of racism. The authors identify seven experiences grounded in the interactions among the forces of racism, class, gender, and history that may influence women's participation in and the effectiveness of preconception and interconception health care. Conclusion. African-American women's health and wellness behaviors are influenced by an experience of racism structurally embedded and made more virulent by its intersection with class, gender, and history. These intersecting forces create what may be a unique exposure that contributes significantly to the proximal determinants of health inequities for African-American women. Health promotion approaches that focus on the individual as the locus of intervention must concomitantly unravel and address the intertwining structural forces that shape individual circumstance in order to improve women's interconceptional health and to reduce disparities.

AB- Purpose. This study reports on an evaluation of the implementation of a pilot interconceptional care program (ICCP) in Chicago and the experiences of the participants in their first postpartum year. Design. A longitudinal, multi-method approach was used to gather data to measure success in achieving project benchmarks and to gain insights into women's experiences after an adverse pregnancy outcome. Setting. The ICCP interventions were provided in two different health care settings. Subjects. Low-income African-American women with a prior adverse pregnancy outcome were recruited to participate. Data on services delivered are available for 220 women; linked interview data are also available for 99 of these women. Intervention. The ICCP focused on the integration of social services, family planning, and medical care provided through a team approach. Measures. An interview questionnaire asked detailed information about interconceptional health status, attitudes, and behaviors. A services database documented all services delivered to each participant. Key informant interviews were conducted with the ICCP project staff. Analysis. Simple frequencies were generated. Chi-square and t-tests were used to compare participants and benchmarks at the two different sites. Results. The planned delivery of interventions based on women's unique interconceptional health needs was often replaced by efforts to address women's socioeconomic needs. Although medical care remained important, participants viewed themselves as healthy and did not view medical care as a priority. Women's perceptions of contraceptive effectiveness were not always in sync with clinical knowledge. Conclusions. Interconceptional care is a complex process of matching interventions and services to meet women's unique needs, including their socioeconomic needs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have endorsed the concept of preconception care (PCC). New tools must be developed to promote PCC. Design. Development and testing of a health information technology system to provide PCC. Setting. An urban safety net hospital and an urban university. Subjects. Community recruitment of 31 women in focus groups and 15 women participating in observed usability testing; 9 students recruited from the Office of Minority Health Preconception Peer Educators program participated in pilot testing for 2 months. Intervention. Online interactive animated character (“Gabby”) designed to identify and modify preconception risks. Measures. Qualitative transcripts, preconception risk assessment, server data for system usage, self-administered satisfaction surveys, and follow-up phone calls. Analysis. Descriptive statistics of subjects' demographics, satisfaction, PCC risks, and system usage. Transcripts coded using NVIVO. Results. Subjects (n = 24) reported an average of 23 preconception risks; in the pilot, 83% of risks added to the “My Health To-Do List” were addressed by the subject. Seventy-three percent of risks identified as contemplative progressed to action or maintenance. Differences were noted in effectiveness of the system based on initial stage of change for each risk. Conclusion. Results suggest that the PCC system could be effective in influencing positive behavior change. Adding stage of change–focused functionality might have added benefits. This system has great potential to assist in the delivery of PCC. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine effects of a Medicaid family planning waiver on the receipt of reproductive health care and pregnancy. Design. The present study uses a quasiexperimental design using data from the California Women's Health Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for exposure and comparison groups, before and after California's Planning Access Care and Treatment waiver. Setting. The setting was California and comparison states. Subjects. The study included women who were ages 18 to 44 years and below 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL), who are eligible for services under the waiver. Measures. The study measured self-reported pregnancy and receipt of routine checkup, clinical breast exam, Pap test, Chlamydia screening, and discussion of birth control with provider in the past year. Analysis. The study analyzes outcomes for exposure and comparison groups using probit regression models based on data both within California and in states without waivers. Results. Estimates from the California Women's Health Survey analysis indicate that among parents 100% to 200% of the FPL, the waiver led to an 8–percentage point increase in the receipt of a routine checkup and a 12–percentage point increase (p = .03) in discussion of birth control. There was an estimated 3–percentage point decline (p = .05) in current pregnancies among nulliparous women. Multistate analysis using the BRFSS confirmed positive effects on routine checkups (p < .01). Conclusions. The waiver appears to have led to a reduction in pregnancy rates and increased receipt of reproductive health care, particularly routine checkups. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To provide estimates for prevalence of health care provider advice offered to reproductive-aged women and to assess their association with behavior change. Design. Cross-sectional study using the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; Setting. Nineteen states/areas. Subjects. Women aged 18 to 44 years with a self-reported history of hypertension or current antihypertensive medication use (n = 2063). Measures. Self-reported hypertension; sociodemographic and health care access indicators; and provider advice and corresponding self-reported behavior change to improve diet, limit salt intake, exercise, and reduce alcohol use. Analysis. We estimated prevalence and prevalence ratios for receipt of provider advice and action to change habits. We calculated 95 % confidence interval (CI) and used x2 tests to assess associations. Results. Overall, 9.8% of reproductive-aged women had self-reported hypertension; most reported receiving advice to change eating habits (72.9%), reduce salt intake (74.6%), and exercise (82.1 %), and most reported making these changes. Only 44.7% reported receiving advice to reduce alcohol intake. Women who received provider advice were more likely to report corresponding behavior change compared to those who did not (prevalence ratios ranged from 1.3195% CI, 1.2-1.5, p <.05] for exercise to 1.6195% CI, 1.4-1.8, p <.05] for reducing alcohol use. Conclusion. Health care providers should routinely advise hypertensive reproductive-aged women about lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure and improve pregnancy outcomes. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>Many health organizations and practitioners in the United States promote preconception health (PCH) to consumers. However, summaries and evaluations of PCH promotional activities are limited.<bold>Design: </bold>We conducted a content analysis of PCH health education materials collected from local-, state-, national-, and federal-level partners by using an existing database of partners, outreach to maternal and child health organizations, and a snowball sampling technique.<bold>Setting: </bold>Not applicable.<bold>Participants: </bold>Not applicable.<bold>Method: </bold>Thirty-two materials were included for analysis, based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. A codebook guided coding of materials' characteristics (type, authorship, language, cost), use of marketing and behavioral strategies to reach the target population (target audience, message framing, call to action), and inclusion of PCH subject matter (clinical-behavioral components).<bold>Results: </bold>The self-assessment of PCH behaviors was the most common material (28%) to appear in the sample. Most materials broadly targeted women, and there was a near-equal distribution in targeting by pregnancy planning status segments (planners and nonplanners). "Practicing PCH benefits the baby's health" was the most common message frame used. Materials contained a wide range of clinical-behavioral components.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Strategic targeting of subgroups of consumers is an important but overlooked strategy. More research is needed around PCH components, in terms of packaging and increasing motivation, which could guide use and placement of clinical-behavioral components within promotional materials.

AB- <bold>Purpose: </bold>To understand couples' notions of preconception health (PCH) and to inform the development of social marketing plans focused on PCH. APPROACH/DESIGN: We used a social marketing perspective to understand how couples considered PCH as a product, its potential price, how it should be promoted, and in what type of places it should be promoted. These variables are typically referred to as the four social marketing P's.<bold>Setting: </bold>Telephone interviews with couples recruited from a national database.<bold>Participants: </bold>A total of 58 couples (116 individuals) were segmented by five couple segments based on pregnancy planning intention and current parental status in which the wife or partner was 18 to 44 years of age. The five segments were combined into three categories: couples who were planning pregnancies, couples who were not planning pregnancies, or couples who were recent parents (interconception).<bold>Method: </bold>Couple-based structured interviews lasting approximately 45 to 60 minutes were conducted via telephone. Questions inquired about couples' experience with PCH and the four social marketing P's.<bold>Results: </bold>Commonalities existed across the four social marketing P's for the different couple segments. Notable couple-related themes that emerged included the importance of couple communication, support, and relationship quality. PCH was more relevant for couples planning a pregnancy, but nonplanning couples understood the benefits of PCH and related behaviors.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Couples may be an important target audience when considering social marketing approaches for PCH. Many couples perceived the relevance of the issue to important aspects of their lives, such as health, family, and their relationships. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

We used NVivo 9 software to analyze focus group data.<bold>Results: </bold>Women planning a pregnancy in the future had different perspectives on PCH as a product than women not planning a pregnancy. Barriers to PCH included lack of social support, addiction, and lack of awareness about PCH. Participants preferred to think of PCH behaviors as "promoting" a healthy baby rather than preventing an unhealthy birth outcome. Many women in the focus groups preferred to hear PCH messages from a health care provider, among other channels.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The results from this research will inform the development of a social marketing plan for PCH and the development of concepts that will be tested with consumers to determine their viability for use in a national campaign.

AB- Purpose. This study examines two newspapers' editorial coverage of issues related to the Healthy People 2010 focus areas and compares the two newspapers. Design. A qualitative study. Setting. Two Los Angeles, California, newspapers. Subjects. The masthead editorials of the Los Angeles Times and La Opinion in the year following the release of Healthy People 2010. Measures. A structured data abstraction instrument was used for descriptive coding. Correspondence to 1 of the 28 Healthy People 2010 focus areas determined whether domestic editorials were about health. Analysis. An ethnographic content analysis. Results. There were 1075 editorials from the Los Angeles Times and 361 from La Opinion; 17% were focused on domestic health issues. Three Healthy People 2010 focus areas dominated: Environmental Health, Injury and Violence Prevention, and Access to Quality Health Services. Ten focus areas did not receive a single mention in the Los Angeles Times, and 19 focus areas lacked editorials in La Opinion. Conclusion. Editorial writers regularly tackled issues related to a Healthy People 2010 focus area. Public health practitioners can meet with their local newspaper editorial board and discuss the nation's health objectives as manifested by Healthy People 2020 and the National Prevention Strategy, thereby promoting policies that support individual and population health.

AB- Objective. The consequences of obesity among older adults are significant, yet few obesity interventions target this group. Unfamiliarily with weight loss intervention effectiveness and concerns that weight loss negatively affects older adults may be inhibiting targeting this group. This paper reviews the evidence on intentional weight loss and effective weight loss interventions for obese older adults to help dispel concerns and guide health promotion practice. Data Source. PubMed articles. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Randomized controlled trials examining behavioral and pharmaceutical rueight loss strategies with 1 year follow-up targeting obese (body mass index > 30) older adults (mean age > 60 years), and studies with quasi-experimental designs examining surgical weight loss strategies targeting older adults were examined. Data Extraction. Abstracts xuere reviewed for study objective relevancy, with relevant articles extracted and reviewed. Data Synthesis. Data were inserted into an analysis matrix. Results. Evidence indicates behavioral strategies are effective in producing significant (all p < .05) weight loss toithout significant risk to obese older adults, but effectiveness evidence for surgical and pharmaceutical strategies for obese older adults is lacking, primarily because this group has not been targeted in trials or analyses did not isolate this group. Conclusion. These findings support the promotion of intentional xoeight loss among obese older adults and provide guidance to health promotion practitioners on effective rueight loss interventions to use with this group.

AB- Purpose. When a patient is diagnosed with lung cancer, members of his/her social network may be more likely to engage in smoking cessation efforts. Proactive telephone counseling combined with a tailored self-directed intervention may be more effective at fironioting smoking cessation than a tailored self-directed intervention alone. Design. Randomized controlled triaL Setting. Four clinical sites. Subjects. Current smokers who are family members and close friends of patients with lung cancer Intervention. Six counselo,tinitiated counseling calls using motivational interviewing techniques and focusing on teaching adaptive coping skills based on the transactional model of stress and coping along with tailored self-directed materials (including nicotine patches, if not contraindicated) (n = 245) vs. tailored self-directed materials (including nicotine patches, if not contraindicated) (n = 251). Measures. Participants were surveyed at baseline and at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months participants. The outcome was 7-day point prevalent abstinence. Analysis. The objective of this study was to test for arm d!ffcences in smoking cessation rates at 2 weeks and 6 months postinlervention (primary) and at 12 months postintervention (secondaiy,). Results. We found no overall effect of the proactive intervention on cessation rates. Among younger participants (age <50), the cessation rate in the intervention group was higher titan in the control group at 2 weeks postintervention (16% vs. 4 %, p = .046). For older participants (age >50), there were no group differences. Conclusion. Proactive telephone counseling focusing on adaptive coping skills was difficult to implement among smokers in bung cancer patients' social network. Although this study did not demonstrate any added benefit to cessation rates, this null finding may be a result of an intervention that was weaker than intended, owing to difficulties in completing the counseling phone calls. We discuss lessons learned and areas for future research in this special population. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine the economic impact of the Iowa City, Iowa, smoke-free restaurant ordinance (IC-SFRO) using an immediate and novel approach. Design. In this retrospective study, food permit licensure served as the measure to assess the IC-SFRO impact. The Iowa City expedience provided an excellent experimental setting, as the ordinance was enacted March I, 2002, and repealed May 7, 2003, because of preemption. Setting. The city of Coralville served as a natural control, as it is contiguous to Iowa City, has similar population demographics, and has never enacted a smoke-free restaurant ordinance. Measures. Food permit licensure data for all Iowa City and Coralville restaurants were obtained from the Johnson County Health Department. Analysis. Differences in restaurant volatility were assessed using Fishers exact probability test. Results. The number of restaurants increased in both Iowa City and Coralville throughout the ordinance period. The ratio of the total number of restaurants in Iowa City to the total number of restaurants in the Iowa City-Coralville metropolitan area remained stable. The proportion of restaurants for each city did not differ significantly during the preordinance, ordinance, and postordinance periods. Conclusion. The IC-SFRO did not adversely impact the restaurant industry in terms of restaurant closures. The Iowa legislature ivas urged to draft evidence-based legislation, such as amending preemption of the IC-SFRO, to protect and promote the health of its communities. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To use direct observations of first prenatal visits to describe obstetric providers' adherence to the evidence-based clinical practice, guideline for smoking cessation counseling recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the 5 A's (Ash, Advice, Assess, Assist, and Arrange). Design. Observational study using audio recordings of first obstetric visits. Setting. An urban academic hospital-based clinic. Participants. Obstetric care providers and pregnant women attending their first obstetric visit. Method. First obstetric visits were audio recorded. Visits ivere identified in which patients reported smoking and discussions were analyzed for obstetric providers' use of the 5 As in smoking cessation counseling. Results. Obstetric providers asked about smoking in 98% of the 116 visits analyzed, but used 3 or more of the 5 A's in only 21 % (24) of visits. In no visits did providers use all 5 A's. In 54 % of the visits, providers gave patients information about smoking, most commonly about risks associated with perinatal smoking. Conclusion. Few obstetric care providers performed the recommended 5 A's smoking cessation counseling with their pregnant smokers.

AB- Purpose. To test the effects of a population-based self-efficacy message card campaign on compliance xoiih a tobacco-free campus policy. Setting. This study was conducted at a large public university in the South. Subjects. Three hundred twelve observational periods at 39 campus sites. Intervention. The message card campaign, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, consisted of distributing approximately 6000 efficacy-enhancing cards over 3 days. The intent of the cards was to increase awareness of the policy and resources available to help individuals stop smoking or remain comfortable zohile on campus. Measures. Policy compliance was measured using the Tobacco-Free Compliance Assessment Tool. Field notes were used to assess campaign reaction. Analysis. Mann-WJiitney U-test loas conducted to compare number of cigarette butts in hot spot areas before and after the intervention. A rate ratio was also calculated using Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping sofliuare to compare cigarette butts collected per day before and after the intervention at each of the study sites. Results. The median number of cigarette butts per day after the intervention ivas significantly lower than before the intervention (1.9 vs. 4. 7, x2 :8.1, p= .004). Eighteen sites (66.6 %) had a post-pre ratio of .11 to . 75, indicating a decrease in cigarette butts per day. Conclusion. An efficacy-enhancing message card campaign shows promise in improving compliance with tobacco-free campus polici.es. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The evidence for the effectiveness of theory of planned behavior (TPB)-based interventions is mixed. There is also mixed evidence on the effectiveness of adding implementation intentions to TPB-based interventions. In this study we assessed and compared the short-term effects of TPB-only intervention and TPB plus implementation intentions intervention on snacking behavior and intention to consume unhealthy snacks in Iranian adolescent girls. Design. Three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. Setting. Ten middle schools in Tehran (Iran). Subjects. A total of 29 classes included 739 female adolescents (age range: 12-15 years). Intervention. Two brief interventions including TPB-only intervention and TPB plus implementation intentions intervention. Measures. Food frequency questionnaire and intentions at baseline, 10 days, and 3 months measuring snacking behavior and cognitions about unhealthy snack consumption, respectively. Analysis. Hierarchical linear modeling to assess the interventions' effects. Results. Both interventions successfully decreased intention to consume and consumption of unhealthy snacks at postinlervenlion. Calculation of the effect sizes revealed that the TPB plus implementation intentions intervention was more effective than the TPB-only intervention. The effects remained significant at 3-month follow-up in the TPB plus implementation intentions intervention group only, although the effect size decreased. Conclusion. Overall, the study suggests that adding implementation intentions on top of TPB-based persuasive messages improves effectiveness and sustainability of desirable changes. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine whether nonbout physical activity (i.e., <10 minutes' duration of physical activity [PA]) demonstrates a stronger association with health outcomes than bout, physical activity (i.e., > 10 minutes' duration). Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. NHANES 2003-2006. Subjects. A total of 6321 participants ranging in age from J 8 to 85 years. Measures. Objectively measured PA zoos assessed using accelerometry. A variety of health outcomes (e.g., triglyceride levels) were objectively measured, including an assessment of metabolic syndrome. Analysis. Multi.vari.ate regression analyses examined the association between bouts and nonbouts on each of the biologic health outcomes. Additionally, differences in each of the biologic variables among those who met PA guidelines for both approaches were evaluated. Results. After adjustments, results were similar for both approaches. For example, the odds ratio (OR) for metabolic syndrome for nonbouts (OR, 1.89; p < .001) zuas similar to thai for bouts (OR, 1.87; p = . 002). With the exception of body mass index, similar values for the biologic variables ivere found between those meeting guidelines for the two PA approaches. Conclusion. Engaging in nonbouts, as opposed, to bouts of PA, is just as strongly associated with several biologic health outcomes, suggesting that adults who perceive themselves as having little lime to exercise may stilt be able to enhance their health by adopting an active lifestyle approach.

AB- Purpose. Examine and compare constraints to physical activity (PA) among Latinos based on age, gender, income, and self-reported leisure time PA (LTPA). Design, Cross-sectional survey. Partnered with a North Carolina nonprofit advocacy organization who recruited community leaders (promotores) to administer the survey to Latino constituents. Setting. Latino communities in Wake County, North Carolina. Subjects. Respondents (N = 457) were mostly women, (58%), with a mean age of 34 years (SD = 11), low income (70% < $39K/year); 78% were born outside the United States, with a majority from Mexico (52%). Measures. Sociodemographics; Stanford Brief PA Survey; constraints on PA xuere measured with 20 items assessing seven constructs (accessibility, facilities, knowledge, partners, psychologic, safety, and time). Analysis. Descriptive statistics, reliability analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, t-tests, and analysis of variance. Results. Half of the sample was inactive. Eight-yone percent indicated that they would like to be more active and perceived lack of accessibility, partners, and knowledge of PA resources as the most constraining factors. Respondents in low-income categories cited significantly higher psychological and accessibility constraints. Inactive LTPA respondents perceived significantly higher constraints overall, with knowledge and accessibility having the largest effect sizes. No differences were found based on age and gender. Conclusions. This study highlighted that among Latinos, there may be an opportunity to increase activity levels by targeting knowledge about PA resources, increasing access to opportunities for PA, and enhancing the social environment for PA. Such efforts that target these constraints to increase PA may ultimately improve health. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine how sociodemographic, health, behavioral, and health care utilization factors are associated with being obese or having diabetes among baby boomers and older adults. Design. Cross-sectional data were drawn from the 200 7-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Setting. United States. Subjects. A sample of 3439 baby boomers and older adults included (mean age, 62 years). Measures. Covariates included socio-demographics, health outcomes, behaviors, and inpatient and outpatient health care utilization. Analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore which similar or different covariates were associated with different health states between baby boomers and older adults. Results. Approximately 8% of baby boomers and 10% of older adults had the twin diagnoses of obesity and diabetes. Having both obesity and diabetes was more common among baby boomers and older adults who were African-American (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79, p = .029 for baby boomers; OR = 3.45, p < .001 for older adults), perceived their general health asfair/ poor (OR = 7.67, p < .001; OR = 4.13, p < .001), and utilized outpatient care more often (OR = 8.28, p < .001; OR = 5.35, p = .004). Being obese only was observed less among baby boomers who were current smokers (OR = .45, p < . 001), whereas it was observed more among older adults who were former smokers (OR = 1.25, p = .046). Having diabetes only was observed more among baby boomers who had hypertension (OR= 2.44, p = .01), whereas it was observed more among older adults who had very high cholesterol (OR = 2.31, p = .029). Conclusion. Identifying chronic disease risk factors during middle age is important for ameliorating further complications in later life. Knowing more about the correlates of obesity and diabetes among different age groups can help health care planners better target preventive health care services. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine the impact of financial incentives on behavior change program registration, completion, and risk improvement rates. Design. Retrospective cohort study conducted to observe the relationship between financial incentives and behavior change program registration, completion, and risk improvement rates. Setting. Large public- or private-sector employers. Subjects. Twenty-four organizations (n = 511,060 eligible employees) that offered comprehensive worksite health promotion (WHF) programs. Intervention. Financial incentives offered for completion of a behavior change program as part of a WHP program. Measures. Behavior change program registration and completion data were obtained from standard reports. Company-level risk change was calculated from the average per-person number of risks on baseline and follow-up health risk assessments. Incentive design was determined from questionnaires completed by WHP program managers. Analysis. Average registration rates, program completion rates, and risk improvement rates were compared using t-tests for companies that did versus did not offer incentives. Comparisons were also made between companies with incentives of less than $100 and those with incentives of $100 or more. Correlations between incentive value and outcome variables were assessed using Pearson correlations. Results. Companies that offered incentives had significantly higher health coaching completion rates than companies not offering an incentive (82.9% vs. 76.4 %, respectively, p = .017) but there was no significant association with registration (p= .384) or risk improvement rates (p= .242). Incentive values were not significantly associated with risk improvement rates (p = .240). Conclusion. Offering incentives for completing behavior change programs may increase completion rates, but increased health improvement does not necessarily follow. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Firefighters are expected to respond to any domestic emergency at a moment's notice, and therefore their health and readiness are key to the public safely net. Although emerging research is focusing on understanding firefighters' increased risk for disease and injury, the perspectives of fire service personnel is lacking. Design. This study uses the cross-sectional qualitative data collection techniques of key informant interviews and focus groups. Setting. Data collection occurred with a national sample of firefighters from 28 (municipal and federal) career fire departments. Participants. Participants were 332 career firefighters (57.2%), company officers (23.4%), fire chiefs (15.4%), and other fire service personnel (3.9%). Method. Focus groups and informant interviews were conducted with firefighters, fire chiefs, health promotion personnel, and medical directors to assess attitudes, opinions, and perceptions about firefighter health. Results. Major themes that developed among fire service personnel included concerns about cancer, risk of cardiovascular disease, the importance of and barriers to physical fitness, the food culture of the firehouse, psychological stress resulting from repeated exposure to trauma, sleep disruptions, injuries, and risk for infectious disease. Health concerns identified by firefighters are juxtaposed with current efforts and trends within the national fire service. Conclusions. The health concerns of firefighters parallel both available epidemiological research and the health priorities of national fire service organizations. Unfortunately, these concerns often are in contrast with efforts by local governments to limit their financial liability for illnesses presumed to be caused by occupational exposures and long-held traditions in the fire service. This study highlights the need for epidemiological surveillance of firefighters and innovative health and organizational policy in the fire service. Future directions for the fire service, the public health community, and researchers are discussed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Study goals were to (1) describe stakeholder perceptions of workplace health promotion (WHP) appropriateness, (2) describe barriers and facilitators to implementing WHP, (3) learn the extent to which WHP programs are offered to workers' spouses and partners and assess attitudes toward including partners in WHP programs, and (4) describe willingness to collaborate with nonprofit agencies to offer WHP. Design. Five 1.5-hour focus groups. Setting. The focus groups were conducted with representatives of midsized (100-999 workers) workplaces in the Seattle metropolitan area, Washington state. Subjects. Thirty-four human resources professionals in charge of WHP programs and policies from five low-wage industries: accommodation/food services, manufacturing, health care/social assistance, education, and retail trade. Measures. A semistructured discussion guide. Analysis. Qualitative analysis of focus group transcripts using grounded theory to identify themes. Results. Most participants viewed WHP as appropriate, but many expressed reservations about intruding in workers' personal lives. Barriers to implementing WHP included cost, time, logistical challenges, and unsupportive culture. Participants saw value in extending WHP programs to workers' partners, but were unsure how to do so. Most were willing to work with nonprofit agencies to offer WHP. Conclusion. Midsized, low-wage employers face significant barriers to implementing WHP; to reach these employers and their workers, nonprofit agencies and WHP vendors need to offer WHP programs that are inexpensive, turnkey, and easy to adapt.

AB- Purpose. To evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) addressing cessation-related weight concerns delivered via a tobacco quitline that does not address weight concerns. Design. Randomized controlled trial, blinded 6-month follow-up. Setting. The Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline (OKHL). Subjects. All 7998 smokers who called the OKHL were screened; 4240 were eligible; 2000 were randomized to the standard quitline (STD) or the brief version of the CBT weight concerns program (WGP.). Intervention. Telephone counseling to help people quit smoking and address concerns about cessation-related weight gain. Measures. Demographics, weight, tobacco status, weight concerns, self-efficacy in quitting, and quitting without weight gain. Analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Results. Of those randomized, 1002 participants completed the 6-month survey (response rates = 53.2% for STD, 47% for WCP). Compared with STD, WCP led to reduced weight concerns (p <.01) and less weight gain among quitters (1.8 vs. -3.4 pounds; p = .01). Although not significant, participants in the WCP were more likely to report 30-day abstinence (33.3% vs. 36.8%, p = .24; intent to treat = 17.7 vs. 17.3). Conclusion. The WCP was successfully delivered via a quitline and resulted in improved attitudes about weight and decreased cessation-related weight gain without harming quit rates. Promotion of a quitline focused on addressing weight in conjunction with quitline treatment for smoking cessation may improve cessation and weight outcomes. Study limitations include use of self-report and survey response. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To describe the factors associated with interest of homeless former smokers in helping homeless smokers quit. Methods. A cross-sectional survey administered to an optimized convenience sample of homeless persons (n = 4570) at emergency shelters, transitional housing units, and open encampments in 80 cities across Minnesota. The in person survey response rate was 90%. Analysis. Chi-square tests and t-tests for univariate analysis. Results. Of 4534 participants completing the smoking questions, 546 participants (12%) self-identified as former smokers, of which 59% expressed interest in helping homeless smokers quit. Significant predictors of reported interest in helping included racial/ethnic background (p <.05), number of people known who had quit smoking (p <.01), and receiving social services as an adult (p <.01). Conclusion. Homeless former smokers are a potential resource for peer support programs to promote smoking cessation among homeless current smokers. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine whether caregiver burdens are associated with lifestyle behaviors 1 year following the hospitalization of a family member with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Design. Prospective follow-up study of National Heart Lung and Blood Institute sponsored Family Intervention Trial for Heart Health participants. Setting. Hospital-based recruitment/baseline visit with 1-year follow-up. Subjects. Family members of hospitalized CVD patients (N = 423; 67% female, 36% racial, ethnic minority; mean age 49 years). Measures. Systematic evaluation at 1 year to determine heart-healthy diet (defined as <10% kcal from saturated fat; Block 98 Food Frequency Questionnaire) and physical activity (defined as ⩾ 4 dl wk; Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey) behaviors and caregiver burdens (five domains: employment, financial, physical, social, and time; Caregiver Strain Questionnaire). Analysis. Logistic regression adjusted for covariates. Results. Heart-healthy diet was less frequent among caregivers citing feeling overwhelmed (odds ratio [OR] = .50; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .26-. 97), sleep disturbance (OR = .51; 95% CI = .27-. 96), financial strain (OR = .41; 95% CI = .20-. 86), upsetting behavior (OR = .48; 95% CI = .25-. 92), and/or time demands (OR = .47; 95% CI = .26-. 85) as burdens. Physical activity was less frequent among caregivers reporting financial strain (OR = .32; 95% CI .13-. 81) or upsetting patient behavior (OR = .33; 95% CI = .15-. 76) as burdens. The most commonly cited caregiver burdens included changes in personal plans (39%), time demands (38%), and sleep disturbance (30%). Conclusion. Caregiver burdens were associated with nonachievement of heart-healthy diet and physical activity behaviors among family caregivers 1 year after patient discharge. When developing heart-health promotion interventions, caregiver burden should be considered as a possible barrier to prevention among family members of CVD patients. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study investigates cardiovascular disease risk factor response in adolescents following introduction of brisk walking into curriculum lessons. Design. Quasi-experimental. Setting. School-based. Subjects. An intervention group consisted of 115 (aged 12.4 ± 0.5 y) year eight participants, and 77 (aged 12.1 ± 1.1 y) year seven and year nine participants formed a control. Intervention. An 18-week cross-curricular physical activity intervention was implemented in one secondary school. Measures. Adiposity variables, blood pressure, lipids, lipoproteins, glucose, insulin, high- sensitivity C-reactive protein, high-molecular-weight adiponectin, aerobic fitness, physical activity behavior, and diet were assessed preintervention and postintervention. Analysis. Dependent and independent t-tests. Results. Prevalence of elevated waist circumference (9.8% vs. 6.9%), systolic blood pressure (3.3% vs. 0%), triglycerides (2.5% vs. 1.2%), and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.7% vs. 2.7%) decreased in the intervention group. Significant improvements in high density lipoprotein cholesterol to total cholesterol ratio (mean ± SD: 2% ± 4% [confidence interval (Cl)0.05 = 1% to 2%], t80 = -3.5, p = .001) and glucose (-.1 ± .4 mmol/L [Cl0.05 = -.2% to 0%], t79 3.2, p = .002) were evident for the intervention group. Conclusion. The Activity Knowledge Circuit may prove to be a sustainable, effective, and cost-effective strategy to engage schoolchildren in physical activity on a daily basis. A longer- duration intervention is required to fully understand risk factor response in adolescents. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Physicians are encouraged to discuss physical activity with their older adult patients. Studies of physician-initiated counseling have yielded inconsistent results, perhaps because older adults' perceptions and concerns about such counseling have not been addressed. The objective of the present work was therefore to explore such perceptions and their implications. Design. Qualitative study, using a grounded theory approach. Data were collected using both focus groups and semistructured interviews. Setting. Data were collected in several settings, including a fitness center and physical offices. Subjects. In a first sample, 56 adults aged 65 and older participated in one of six focus group sessions examining physical activity and exercise. Subsequently, 16 older adults participated in one of two focus groups comprising a second, validation sample. Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with a sample of five physicians. Methods. Data collection and analysis took place concurrently. Transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Recruitment, data collection, and analysis were informed by grounded theory. Results. Inactive older adults experiencing a health problem were more receptive than their healthy counterparts to receiving physical activity counseling from their physicians. Those who were receptive appeared to find such an intervention useful in leading to behavior change. Conclusion. This study suggests that physicians' efforts in physical activity counseling may have the best impact when provided in the context of a health problem. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To provide initial tests of internal consistency reliability and both structural and concurrent validity of a smoker identity (SI) scale for college student populations. Design. Cross-sectional design. Setting. Midsouth university. Participants. Undergraduates in a random sample of university classes completed surveys (92.3% response rate). Method. SI items derived from a literature review and clinical expertise, lifetime and current tobacco use, cigarette purchasing patterns, and quitting variables. Analysis. Current (some days or every day) cigarette users (n = 362) were divided into daily, intermittent, and experimental smoker groups. After principal components analysis was conducted on the SI items, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess SI differentiation of smoker groups, and correlational analysis or ANOVA was used to assess SI relationships with smoking and quitting variables. Results. Eight SI items produced a high-internal-consistency, single-factor structure (a = .93) and clearly differentiated the three smoker groups. Higher SI scores indicated greater smoking rate, smoking within 30 minutes of awakening, larger purchased quantities, and both greater interest and lower confidence in quitting. Conclusions. The scale demonstrated good reliability and validity. Other SI measures exist, but this is the first scale to establish utility with experimental and intermittent smokers-substantial groups among college students. The extent to which cigarette users identify as smokers may provide useful information beyond behavioral measures, especially among college students. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine changes in parent-child communication related to sexual behavior after exposure to public health messages. Design. Randomized, controlled trial that was part of precampaign message testing. Setting. Exposure occurred online or through DVDs mailed to participants and viewed on their personal computers. Data collection occurred via a secure Web site. Patients. Participants included parents (n = 1969) living with a child age 10 to 14 years drawn from a nationally representative sample of US. households. Intervention. Treatment participants were exposed to video, audio, and print advertisements that promoted the benefits of speaking to their children early and often about delaying initiation of sexual activity; messages also directed parents to an informational Web site. Measures. The dependent variable assessed frequency of parent-child communication related to sexual behavior. The primary independent variable was treatment assignment. Analysis. Longitudinal growth modeling that included five waves of data. Results. The trajectory of growth over time differed between fathers in the treatment group and fathers in the control group (F[1, 2357] = 4.15; p < .042), indicating more frequent communication among treatment fathers than among control fathers. Trajectories did not differ between mothers in treatment and control groups. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that father-child and mother-child communication patterns differ over time in response to public health messages. Findings have implication for researchers developing health marketing campaigns. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by a constellation of metabolic risk factors that consist of the following: atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, elevated glucose associated with insulin resistance, prothrombotic state, and proinflammatory slate. The objective of the study was to quantify the prevalence of MetS among college students and to determine whether fatness (body mass index [BMI] and waist circumference) or physical activity was more strongly associated with individual components of the MetS. Design. A cross-sectional study. Setting. Eau Claire, Wisconsin, United States. Subjects. Authors collected health history information and performed assessments of individual MetS components for 207 college students aged 18 to 24 years. Measures. Physical activity levels were self-reported, while direct measurements were obtained for MetS components (waist circumference, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, blood glucose). Analysis. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis. Results. The prevalence of MetS was found to be 6.8% according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. The authors also found that 42.5% and 13.0% of our sample had one and two MetS components, respectively. Waist circumference was independently associated (p <.05) with HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure. Conclusion. Our findings provide evidence for the presence of MetS on college campuses. It also appears, in part, that central adiposity contributes to the high incidence of individual MetS components. Given the elevated lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease and lower survival for those with risk factors in young adulthood, there appears to be a need for primary prevention programs within university and college settings.

AB- Purpose. To review published state tobacco control plans (STCPs) to determine the extent to which the needs of the states' populations are being addressed. Design. A qualitative cross-sectional comparison of states' strategic plans for tobacco control as of March 2010. Setting. Online searches. Participants. The 50 states and the District of Columbia. Method. Internet-based searches were completed using tobacco and other keywords (control, prevention, strategies, comprehensive/strategic plan) to obtain all publicly available STCPs; telephone follow-up was conducted to ensure that all publicly available plans were captured. Each plan was coded by two researchers using a standardized protocol to assess provisions made for addressing disparate populations as defined by the states. Results. A total of 43 states addressed disparate populations. Thirty-six states addressed these populations within published STCPs, six states had separate stand-alone tobacco disparities plans, and one addressed it within their cancer plan. Specific populations addressed included racial and ethnic minorities, blue-collar employees, pregnant women, children under the age of 18, and college students. There were also several STCPs that cited the general goal of eliminating tobacco use disparities. Conclusion. More work is needed to address tobacco disparities, including additional planning efforts in some states and effective implementation and evaluation among states with plans. States can look to the experiences of other states to help guide tobacco control planning for their own populations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. We examined the relationships among fruit and vegetable intake, alcohol consumption, and socioeconomic status (SES). We hypothesized that fruit and vegetable consumption would be inversely associated with alcohol consumption and the relationship would differ by SES. Design. A cross-sectional analysis. Setting. Large, urban Midwestern county. Subjects. A unique, racially/ethnically diverse sample of 9959 adults (response rate: 66.3%). Measures. Fruit and vegetable intake was measured using two items that assessed servings per day. Alcohol consumption was measured in terms of volume of alcohol consumed and binge drinking. Individual measures of SES included education and household income. Analysis. Weighted multivariate linear and Poisson regression were used to estimate effects. Results. The relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and alcohol consumption varied by SES. Those with lower household incomes who consumed five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day were less likely to engage in binge drinking relative to those consuming zero to one servings of fruits and vegetables per day (risk ratio = .66; 95% confidence interval: .46, .95). No association was observed for higher-household-income individuals. Conclusion. We observed an inverse relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and alcohol intake in those with lower household incomes but not in those with higher household incomes. Results suggest that the relationship between diet and alcohol consumption may be more relevant in populations with more restricted economic choices. Results are, however, based on cross-sectional data. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To assess whether state-sponsored agricultural marketing programs had a positive influence on adult consumers `fruit and vegetable consumption. Design. Differences in fruit and vegetable consumption between 2000 and 2005 in states that initiated marketing campaigns during this period and those that did not were examined. Subjects. A representative sample (n = 237, 320) of adults aged 18 and older from states with and without marketing programs was used. The study used data from the 2000 and 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Measures. The number of fruit and vegetable servings per week and the percentage of respondents consuming five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day were examined. Analysis. Between-subjects analysis of variance and logistic regression. Results. In the absence of a marketing campaign, there was a significant decrease in fruit and vegetable consumption between 2000 and 2005. In states with campaigns, consumption remained stable or increased. Marketing effects were stronger for women than for men. Conclusions. State-sponsored agricultural marketing programs had favorable effects on consumers' consumption of fruits and vegetables.

AB- Purpose. To assess changes in children's health behaviors and weight status after participation in community-originated interventions. Design. Prospective cohort study following body mass index (BMI) z-score trajectory over time. Setting. Schools and community settings in 19 locations in North Carolina. Subjects. A total of 1144 children, with an average age of 9.5 years, participating in community-originated physical activity and nutrition interventions, such as active recess and healthy cafeteria offerings, and environment and policy changes designed to prevent and reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity. Retention from baseline to final collection was 54%. Measures. Self-reported physical activity and eating behaviors; measured height and weight were collected at baseline and after interventions (average of 20 months). Z-score was compared with expected growth without intervention. Analysis. Descriptive statistics, χ2 tests and t-tests, and ANOVA analyses of variance to assess changes in health behaviors and weight status. Results. More than 11 % of children improved their weight status, and 86% of children who began at a healthy weight remained there. The average BMI for children who were overweight at enrollment was significantly lower after intervention (1.1 kg/m2 lower for boys and 0.88 kg/m2 lower for girls). Overweight and obese children who made improvements in key health behaviors showed greater decreases in BMI z-score than those who did not improve those behaviors (increased fruit [-.2207 vs. -.0793] and vegetable [-.2215 vs. -.0855] intake, and drinking less soda [-.1985 vs. -.0912]). There were no significant increases in physical activity, and changes in physical activity were not related to decreases in BMI z-score in this study. Conclusion. Community-originated interventions to raise awareness about food choices and to change policies and environments may improve BMI z-scores. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine relationships between physical activity (PA) and awareness and treatment status of low bone mineral density (BMD) among adults. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. Stratified sample of adults living independently in the community. Subjects. A total of 1928 adults aged 50 years and older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006 were included in the analysis. Among those, about 54% were women, 84% were non-Hispanic whites, 65% were married, and 44% were between 50 and 59 years of age. Measures. Objective measures: femoral neck BMD and duration of PA and step counts measured by accelerometers. Self-report: strength exercise, and awareness and treatment of low bone density. Analysis. Multivariate regression analyses using SUDAAN. Results. Despite a high prevalence of low BMD, self-reported awareness, treatment, and PA were very low. After controlling socio-demographic and health-related factors, those who were aware of their low bone density status and who received treatment for it were less physically active than those who were unaware of their bone condition or who did not have any treatment. Conclusions. PA levels are below the recommended level for bone health benefits. Health care providers should consider screening individuals at risk of low bone density and encourage them to implement prevention and treatment regimen including increasing daily levels of PA.

AB- Purpose. To examine the construct validity and 2-month test-retest reliability of a staging measure for assessing readiness to consume five or more daily servings offruits and vegetables among economically disadvantaged African-American adolescents. Design. Longitudinal survey. Setting. Youth services agencies serving low-income communities in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Subjects. African-American adolescents (N = 390) aged 11 to 14 years. Measures. Self-report measures of stage of change and fruit and vegetable consumption. Analysis. Correlation analysis and analysis of covariance were used to examine, cross- sectionally, whether fruit and vegetable consumption differed by stage of change (validity assessment). Correlation analysis and Cohen's kappa (κ) were used to assess the degree of association and level of agreement between stages longitudinally (test-retest reliability assessment). Results. Fruit and vegetable consumption was moderately correlated with stage of change (r ≥ .54, p = .000). Consistent with the transtheoretical model, youths' consumption increased from earlier to later stages (p = .000). Forty-six percent ofyouths were in the same stage at both measurements. The correlation between stages was .26, and Cohen's κ was .20 (p = .000). Conclusions. Despite preliminary evidence of construct validity, the low test-retest reliability found suggests that further research and testing are needed to improve the stability of the measure.

AB- Purpose. To examine whether residing in a community designed to promote physical activity moderates the relationship between parent perceptions of the neighborhood and general physical activity or active commuting to school in their children. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. San Bernardino County, California. Subjects. Three hundred sixty-five families (one parent and one child in grades four through eight). Eighty-five reside in a smart growth community designed to be more conducive to physical activity. Measures. Parent perceptions assessed using the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS). General child physical activity was measured using accelerometers, and active commuting was self-reported by children. Analysis. Two sets of regressions were performed: one for general physical activity, and one for active commuting. Separate models were run in the two sets for each of the 14 NEWS factors, while controlling for demographics. Results. For general physical activity, walking infrastructure, lack of cul-de-sacs, and social interaction had significant main effect associations (p ≤ .05). No factors were moderated by community. The relationships between active commuting to school and perceived crime, traffic hazards, hilliness, physical barriers, cul-de-sac connectivity, aesthetics, and walking infrastructure were Significant for those in the smart growth community only (p ≤ .05). Conclusions. Living in an activity-friendly environment is associated with positive relationships between parent perceptions and active iommuting behaviors in children. Future interventions should account for both the perceived neighborhood environment and available physical activity infrastructure. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine if spatial access to healthy and unhealthy outlets comprising the local food environment was associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. Population-based sample residing in Hawaii. Subjects. Three hundred and eighty-four adults (36% Asian-American, 33% non- Hispanic white, 31 % other/mixed race). Measures. A spatial model of the local food environment was constructed using radial buffers extendingfrom participants' place of residence. Fruit and vegetable intake was estimated using the National Cancer Institute Fruit and Vegetable All-Day Screener. Analysis. Mean intakes of fruits and vegetables were compared for spatial access to total, healthy, and unhealthy food outlets at distances of .5 to 3.5 km. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate differences in fruit and vegetable intake for residing further from a food outlet or for residing in an area with a greater number offood outlets. Results. Residing in an area with a greater density of total or healthy food outlets was associated with a higher mean intake offruits and vegetables (p <.05) at .5 km. No differences in mean intakes were detected for distances beyond .5 km or for regression models. Conclusion. Findings suggest that greater spatial accessibility to food outlets comprising the local food environment in Hawaii may not be meaningfully associated with fruit and vegetable consumption; however, associations were detected for the smallest spatial scale examined, warranting further investigation.

AB- Purpose. Industry-based strategies for dissemination of an evidence-based occupational sun protection program, Go Sun Smart (GSS), were tested. Design. Two dissemination strategies were compared in a randomized trial in 2004-2007. Setting. The North American ski industry. Subjects. Ski areas in the United States and Canada (n = 69) and their senior managers (n = 469). Intervention. Employers received GSS through a basic dissemination strategy (BDS) from the industry's professional association that included conference presentations and free starter kits. Half of the areas also received the enhanced dissemination strategy (EDS), in which project staff met face-to-face with managers and made ongoing contacts to support program use. Measures. Observation of program materials in use and managers' reports on communication about sun protection. Analysis. The effects of two alternative dissemination strategies were compared on program use using PROC MIXED in SAS, adjusted for covariates using one-tailed p values. Results. Ski areas receiving the EDS used more GSS materials (x̄ = 7.36) than those receiving the BDS (x̄ = 5.17; F = 7.82, p <.01). Managers from more areas receiving the EDS reported communicating about sun protection in employee newsletters/flyers (x̄ = .97, p = .04), in guest e-mail messages (x̄ = . 75, p = .02), and on ski area Web sites (x̄ = .38, p = .02) than those receiving the BDS (x̄ = .84, .50, .15, respectively). Conclusion. Industry professional associations play an important role in disseminating prevention programs; however, active personal communication may be essential to ensure increased implementation fidelity.

AB- Purpose. In the energy and mining sectors, it is commonfor employees to work in geographically remote locations, often with a medic for emergency response. This study evaluated an intervention to increase the number of medics conducting health promotion in remote worksites. Design. Interviews were conducted to gather data for informing intervention and survey development. The intervention was evaluated in a quasiexperimental posttest-only comparison group design using survey data collected at baseline and again after 12 months. Setting. The intervention was implemented in remote worksites (N = 201). There were 96 worksites in the intervention condition and 105 sites in the control condition. Subjects. The target population was medics, including nurses, doctors, and paramedics, operating in remote work.sites in 44 countries. Intervention. The intervention was a series of campaign tool kits. The tool kits were adapted to the remote environment and could be customized for culture, language, and education level. Measures. The survey assessed frequency of health promotion activities, satisfaction with the intervention, and barriers to implementation. Analysis. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and X² tests. Interview results were coded to identify themes. Results. Most medics (88%) in the intervention group reported running "tool box talks" (short education sessions) on at least a monthly basis, compared with 78% in the comparison group (p = .056). The trend was similarfor displaying posters (?1 % vs. 55%; p = .021) and advocating for policy changes (84% vs. 71%; p = .027). Medic satisfaction was high. Difficulty distributing tool kits was the main barrier to implementation. Conclusions. When provided with appropriate tools, medics may be an ideal channel for health promotion in remote worksites.

AB- Purpose. Efforts to screen underinsured women for breast cancer face challenges in reaching desired audiences. One option is viral marketing through peer referral. We sought the optimal way to solicit nominations of peers. Design. An experiment (N = 2968) compared impact of incentives on peer nomination. Women were offered a $20 incentive each time someone they referred was screened, a $5 incentive for each name and valid address or phone number (regardless of screening completion), or no financial incentive for nomination. Setting. Study sample was drawn from free mammography program participants in Minnesota. Analysis. Post hoc Scheffé t-tests compared conditions on nominees per invitation card sent (N = 2968), mean number of nominees scheduling mammogram per referrer (n = 107), and proportion of total nominees (N = 1041) scheduling a mammogram for each incentive condition. Results. Offering $5 per nomination yielded .52 nominations per referral invitation sent, compared to .36 nominations per invitation sent for $20 per completed mammogram and only .17 nominations per invitation in the no incentive group. In the no incentive condition, however, each referrer generated .35 scheduled mammograms on average, which was statistically equivalent to the .16 scheduled mammograms delivered on average by $20 per completed mammogram referrers and statistically superior, p <.05, to the .09 rate produced by $5 per name referrers. Conclusion. Programs interested in peer referral could productively pursue the strategy without incurring incentive costs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study was conducted to determine if physical activity volume (PAv) and intensity (PAi) at baseline influence the likelihood of gaining hip bone mineral density (BMD) over 6 years. Design and Sample. In a prospective study, the sample was limited to 244 female nonsmokers, ages 35 to 45 years, and was approximately 90% white. Setting and Measures. PAv and PAi were measured in daily living conditions using accelerometers at baseline. BMD, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and several confounding factors were measured in the lab. Analysis. On the basis of BMD change scores, participants were divided into three categories: BMD loss, minimal change, and BMD gain. Risk ratios were used to show the likelihood of BMD gains over time across different levels of PAv and PAi at baseline. Results. Women with higher PAv were more likely to show improvements in hip BMD from baseline to follow-up than their counterparts, as indicated by the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square (X² mh = 6.1, p = .01). Women with high PAv were 2.50 times (95% CI, 1.19-5.24) more likely to experience hip BMD gains than women with low PAy, and women with moderate PAv were 2.20 times (95% CI, 1.08-4.45) more likely. PAi was not predictive of gains in hip BMD. Adjusting for potential confounders had little influence on the results. Conclusions. Middle-aged women with moderate or high levels of PAv are more likely to experience BMD gains at the hip over time compared with those who have low levels of PAv. However, PAi does not appear to influence the likelihood of gaining BMD at the hip over 6 years. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine the relationship between vigorous physical activity and dementia risk. Design. Prospective study design utilizing physical activity data from the Health and Retirement Study and cognitive outcome data from the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study. Setting Community-based. Subjects. Adults age 71 and over (N = 808) with 3 to 7 years of physical activity information prior to dementia/no dementia diagnosis. Measures. Physical activity was measured by participation in vigorous activities such as aerobics, sports, running, biycling, and heavy housework three or more times per week (yes/no). Dementia diagnosis was based on an expert panel (e.g., neuropsychologists, neurologists, gerapsychiatrists) who performed and reviewed a battery of neuropsychological tests. Analysis. Binary logistic regression models were used to account for demographic characteristics, genetic risk factors (one or two apolipoprotein E ϵ4 alleles), health behaviors (e.g., smoking, drinking alcohol), health indicators (body mass index), and health conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease) in a sequential model-building process. Results. The relationship between vigorous physical activity and dementia risk remained robust across models. In the final model, older adults who were physically active were 21 % (p ≤ .05) less likely than their counterparts to be diagnosed with dementia. Conclusion. Vigorous physical activity may reduce the risk for dementia independently of the factors examined here. This study's findings are important given that few preventative strategies for dementia have been explored beyond hormonal therapy and anti-inflammatory drugs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- The author offers opinions on U.S. medical care and the U.S. budget. It is argued that an effective means of reducing the budget deficit would be to control medical care costs through health promotion, as practices such as tobacco use, poor nutrition and lack of exercise contribute to increases in chronic diseases whose treatment accounts for a large share of all spending on medical care. It is stated that an annual appropriation of $62 billion for health promotion would result in reductions in medical care spending that would reduce the U.S. public debt by 15 percent in 25 years.

AB- Purpose. African-Americans have high rates of physical inactivity-related morbidity and mortality, thus effective interventions to increase exercise are necessary. Tailored interventions show promise, but measures need validation in this population. This study validated transtheoretical model measures for exercise in an African-American sample. Design. Cross-sectional measure development. Setting. Telephone survey of individuals in North Carolina. Subjects. 521 African-American adults. Measures. Stages of change, decisional balance (pros and cons), self-efficacy and processes of change (POC) for regular exercise. Analysis. Confirmatory factor analyses tested measurement models. Multivariate analyses examined relationships between each construct and stages of change. Results. For decisional balance, the two-factor uncorrelated model was the most parsimonious good-fitting model (χ235 = 158.76; comparative fit index [CFI], .92; average absolute standardized residual [AASR], .04), and alphas were good (pros α = .85 and cons α = .74). The one-factor model for self-efficacy (α = .80) revealed an excellent fit (χ29 = 45.51; CFI, .96; AASR, .03). For the POC subscales with good alphas (α = .62-.91), a 10-factor fully correlated model fit best (χ2[360] = 786.75; CFI, .91; AASR, .04). Multivariate analyses by stage of change replicated expected patterns for the pros, self-efficacy, and POC measures with medium-sized effects (η2 = .05-.13). Results by stage of change did not replicate for the cons scale. Conclusions. The structures of these measures replicated with good internal and external validity, except for the cons scale, which requires additional development. Results support the use of these measures in tailored interventions to increase exercise among African-Americans. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this study was to assess novel methods of health education and promotion to increase physical activity among adults with intellectual disabilities. Design. A pre-post delayed treatment design was employed to assess the effect of the intervention. Setting. The intervention was administered at two agencies that serve adults with intellectual disabilities. Subjects. Forty-two adults ranging in age from 19 to 62 with mild to moderate intellectual disability participated in the study. Participants were equally divided by gender. Intervention. An eight-session intervention employed a combination of video instruction, pictorial memory tools, and interactive class activities as educational methods. Measures. Physical activity knowledge was evaluated using Illingworth, Moore, and McGillivray's Nutrition Activity Knowledge Scale (NAKS) and the Physical Activity Recommendations Assessment (PARA). Average daily minutes of physical activity were measured using dual-axis accelerometers. Analysis. Paired and independent samples t-tests were used to assess the knowledge scales. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to assess physical activity participation. Results. Overall, there were mean improvements in scores for both the NAKS (p < .05) and the PARA (p < .001) following the intervention. Physical activity also improved, but not significantly. Conclusion. The education and training methods used in this curriculum are promising for future health education programs in this population. Additional interventions may be necessary to improve physical activity participation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study aimed to examine college student physical activity promotion. Design. A cross-sectional approach to qualitative research was used. Setting. Southeastern state university system. Participants. Fourteen of 15 (93%) universities recruited were included in this study; 22 university employees participated in a semistructured interview. Method. Nonprobabilistic purposive and snowball sampling strategies were used to recruit individuals who were likely to be engaged in physical activity promotion efforts on their respective campuses. Thematic analyses lead to the identification of emerging themes that were coded and analyzed using NVivo software. Results. Themes informed three main areas: key personnel responsible for promoting physical activity to students, actual physical activity promotion efforts implemented, and factors that influence student physical activity promotion. Results suggest that ecological approaches to promote physical activity on college campuses are underused, the targeting of mediators of physical activity in college students is limited, and values held by university administration influence campus physical activity promotion. Conclusion. Findings support recommendations for future research and practice. Practitioners should attempt to implement social ecological approaches that target scientifically established mediators of physical activity in college students. Replication of this study is needed to compare these findings with other types of universities, and to investigate the relationship between promotion activities (type and exposure) and physical activity behaviors of college students.

AB- Purpose. Recognition regarding the importance of health culture in the worksite health promotion literature is growing; however, little empirical evidence exists to guide programmatic or research efforts. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the health supporting structural features of the workplace and perceived health culture. Design. Cross-sectional. Sample. Twenty-one worksites with culture data from 2467 employees from Western New York. Measures. The Heart Check (HC) and Lifegain Health Culture Audit (LHCA) were used to assess worksite environment and worksite health culture, respectively. Analysis. Pearson r was used to examine the associations between HC factors and LHCA mean scores. Multiple linear regression was used to predict LHCA mean scores from selected HC factors. Results. Adjusting for age and gender, several significant correlations between HC and LHCA scores were identified, ranging from r = .54 (p < .05) to r = .72 (p < .001). The HC Environmental Structure factor (HCES) and HC Communication factor (HCC) were significantly correlated to LHCA scores (r = .55 and r = .72, respectively; p < .01) but not to each other. A regression model combining HCES and HCC was found to be predictive of LHCA score (R2 = .69, p < .001). Conclusions. Modifiable components of the worksite environment are strongly and positively related to employee perceptions of the worksite health culture. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Identify the influence of medical mistrust, fears, attitudes, and sociodemographic characteristics on unwillingness to participate in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Design. Cross-sectional, disproportionally allocated, stratified, random-digit-dial telephone questionnaire of noninstitutionalized households. Setting. New York City, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; San Juan, Puerto Rico. Subjects. Ethnically diverse sample of 454 adults ⩾50 years of age. Measures. Health status, cancer screening effectiveness, psychosocial factors (e.g., perceptions of pain, fear, trust), and CRC screening intentions using the Cancer Screening Questionnaire, which addresses a range of issues related to willingness of minorities to participate in cancer screening. Analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the probability of reporting unwillingness to participate in CRC screening. Results. Fear of embarrassment during screening (odds ratio [OR] = 10.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.15-53.39), fear of getting AIDS (OR = 8.75; 95% CI, 2.48-30.86), fear that exam might be painful (OR = 3.43; 95% CI, 1.03-11.35), and older age (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17) were positively associated with unwillingness to participate in CRC screening. Fear of developing cancer (OR = .12; 95% CI, .03-.57) and medical mistrust (OR = .19; 95% CI, .06-.60) were negatively associated with unwillingness to screen. Conclusions. Findings suggest that CRC health initiatives should focus on increasing knowledge, addressing fears and mistrust, and normalizing CRC screening as a beneficial preventive practice, and should increase focus on older adults.

AB- Purpose. Describe small business support for youth physical activity opportunities (YPAO) and identify factors associated with this support. Design. Cross-sectional analysis of quantitative data relating business characteristics and support for YPAO. Setting. Eight demographically heterogeneous, urban neighborhoods in a Midwest metropolitan area. Subjects. Adult small business owners (n = 90; 65% response rate; mean age 48.4 years; 73.3% male; 45.2% minority). Measures. Neighborhood demographics from the 2000 U.S. Census and self-reported business and owner characteristics. Analysis. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to contrast business and owner characteristics between businesses that did and did not support YPAO. Results. Businesses supporting YPAO had larger annual operating (F = 7.6; p = .018) and advertising budgets (F = 8.5; p = .009) and had younger owners (F = 6.1; p = .034), with sports backgrounds (χ2 = 5.6; p = .018) and who felt businesses should support YPAO (χ2 = 3.8; p = .048). Of the 46 businesses not supporting YPAO, 82.6% felt small businesses should support YPAO. The major reasons for nonsupport were difficulty identifying YPAO to support and not being asked for support. Conclusions. Business (e.g., budgets) and business owner characteristics (e.g., age), owner connectedness with YPAO, and the approach used for garnering support (active solicitation, clearly defined support mechanism) were associated with supporting YPAO. Additional business (e.g., annual revenues), owner (e.g., perceptions of YPAO), and environmental (e.g., crime rate, land use) factors should be examined as potential correlates.

AB- Purpose. To examine pathways between individual, social, and environmental factors associated with leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) among Mexican-American adults. Design. Cross-sectional design using random-digit dialing to administer a structured telephone interview. Setting. Mexican-American adults living in a U.S.-Mexican border community in San Diego, California (N = 672). Measures. Data were collected on LTPA, demographic characteristics, acculturation, and other psychosocial and environmental factors associated with LTPA. Analysis. Structural equation modeling to test an a priori model of LTPA. Results. Participants were mostly female (71%) with a mean age of 39 years (SD = 13). Only 32% of participants met PA guidelines in their leisure time, with men (39%) meeting the guidelines more than women (29%). Using structural equation modeling, neighborhood factors, both social and environmental, showed indirect relationships with meeting PA guidelines through community resource factors. Significant covariates included marital status and age. Conclusion. Individual, social, and environmental factors were associated with LTPA in this sample of Mexican-American adults. These findings can inform intervention studies that aim to increase LTPA in this population. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine the effect of parental support on sedentary behaviors among Hispanic children. Design and Setting. A longitudinal quasi-experimental design with five waves of data collection was used to examine the effect of parental support on children's sedentary behaviors in a school-based intervention program in west Texas. Subjects. Hispanic low-income parents and their children of 5 to 9 years (N = 416 child-parent dyads) over a 22-month period (1217 observations). Intervention. Transformacion Para Salud was a multicomponent intervention program aimed at prevention and control of childhood overweight and obesity. It used a community-based participatory research approach, including nutrition education, physical exercise, gardening, and family involvement. Measures. Sedentary behaviors were measured by parents' report of their children's daily screen time per week, including TV/DVD, computer, Internet, and video games. Parental support was measured with parents' reported support for active living. Analysis. Growth curve analysis was used to examine trajectories of sedentary behaviors of children. Results. Response rate was over 70%. Parental support reduced children's sedentary behaviors. Girls were less sedentary than boys, but girls were less affected by parental support. The intervention was effective in reducing children's sedentary behaviors over time. Conclusion. It is important for school intervention programs to mobilize parents to provide more support to reduce sedentary behaviors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To assess a single-semester university general education (GE) health and wellness course influence on physical activity (PA) and dietary habits among university students and to compare the course delivered through lecture or online for these outcomes. Design. A 15-week intervention with pre-post one-group design, allowing for comparative assessments in dietary and PA habits across time by delivery method (classroom lecture vs. online). Setting. A large Western university. Participants. Participants (n ?=? 1638, female; n = 1333, male) were 82% university freshman or sophomores. Intervention. Participants were required to take a GE health and wellness course either by classroom lecture or online. The lecture and online curriculum content were similar. Participation in the study was entirely voluntary and was not connected to course grade. Measures. PA and dietary outcomes were determined from questions used in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey and were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Other validated questions were used to assess fitness. Analysis. The general linear model was utilized to determine group x period interactions when comparing the classroom lecture vs. online course. Results. Students improved overall level of PA by 12%, daily minutes of moderate-intensity PA by 8%, and fitness level by 2%. Students improved fruit/vegetable consumption by 4%, bran/whole grain cereal consumption by 8%, and brown rice/whole wheat bread consumption by 11%. All improvements were statistically significant (p < .001) with percent values indicating the size of the effect. The classroom lecture course yielded stronger improvements in several PA and dietary outcomes than the online course. Conclusions. A single-semester university wellness course may positively influence multiple PA and dietary behaviors; however, classroom lecture may be superior to online delivery. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

As the author stated, financial incentives play an important role in motivation for change creating double participation effect. New health behaviors are created as the participation gives a feeling of being energized and accomplishment by achieving a goal. From financial perspective, employees which have received health insurance from the employer and include in the group of health risks like obesity, smoking, hypertension and hyperglycemia get a better deal.

AB- Purpose: To describe the process of translating an evidence-based, telephone-delivered physical activity and dietary behavior change intervention from research into practice. Design: Descriptive case study. Setting/Subjects: Nongovernment, primary medical care-based community health organization. Intervention: Telephone-delivered intervention targeting physical activity and diet in primary medical care patients. Measures/Analysis: Systematic documentation of process outcomes related to intervention adoption and adaptation. Results: Research-community partnerships were critical in facilitating translation, including (1) an initial competitive advantage within a State Health Department-funded preventive health initiative; (2) advocacy to ensure the adoption of the intervention, (3) subsequent support for the adaptation of program elements to ensure fit of the program with the community organization's objectives and capacities, while maintaining feasible elements of fidelity with the original evidence-based program; (4) the integration of program management and evaluation systems within the community organization; and (5) ongoing support for staff members responsible for program delivery and evaluation. Preliminary process evaluation of the Optimal Health Program supports the acceptability and feasibility of the program within community practice. Conclusions: Intervention characteristics central to adoption can be influenced by research-community partnerships. It is likely that evidence-based interventions will need to be adapted for delivery within the real world. Researchers should endeavor to provide training and support to ensure, as much as possible, fidelity with the original program, and that the relevant adaptations are evidence based.

AB- Purpose. To compare changes in medical costs between participants and nonparticipants in five different health and productivity management (HPM) programs. Design. Quasi-experimental pre/post intervention study. Setting. A large financial services corporation. Subjects. A cohort population of employees enrolled in medical plans (n = 49,793). Intervention. A comprehensive HPM program, which addressed health risks, acute and chronic conditions, and psychosocial disorders from 2005 to 2007. Incentives were used to encourage health risk assessment participation in years 2 and 3. Measures. Program participation and medical claims data were collected for members at the end of each program year to assess the change in total costs from the baseline period. Analysis. Multivariate analyses for participation categories were conducted comparing baseline versus program year cost differences, controlling for demographics. Results. All participation categories yielded a lower cost increase compared to nonparticipation and a positive return on investment (ROI) for years 2 and 3, resulting in a 2.451 ROI for the combined program years. Conclusion. Medical cost savings exceeded program costs in a wide variety of health and productivity management programs by the second year. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To measure the concordance of directly and indirectly measured neighborhood attributes and to determine the correlates of the concordance between directly and indirectly measured built environment attributes. Design. Environmental cross-sectional design. Setting. Urban and suburban neighborhoods within Harris County, Houston, and Travis County, Austin, Texas. Subjects. Community-dwelling African-American and Hispanic or Latina women. Measures. Physical activity resource accessibility, path maintenance, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities were measured directly and indirectly. Directly or objectively measured neighborhood attributes were measured by the Physical Activity Resource Assessment and Pedestrian Environmental Data Scan instruments. Indirectly measured or self-reported neighborhood attributes were measured by the International Physical Activity Prevalence Study environmental survey module. Analysis. Logistic regression was used to measure the concordance between directly and indirectly measured neighborhood attributes with ethnicity as a covariate. Residual values were calculated to determine the strength and direction of concordance. Results. Participants' (N = 409) average body mass index (BMI) was classified as obese (MBMI = 34.5 kg/m², SD = 7.9), and the mean body fat percentage was 42.8% (SD = 7.1). The correlates BMI, body fat percentage, physical activity, and ethnicity were not significantly associated with any built environment attribute or concordance value, and none of our models significantly predicted indirectly measured built environment attributes. Conclusion. Being less familiar with certain built environment attributes may not be associated with weight status or physical activity levels among African-American and Hispanic or Latina women.

AB- Purpose. To examine the impact of a small-changes weight loss program across a 3-month intervention followed by a 6-month follow-up program. Design. A one-group pre-post intervention study. Setting. Medium-sized Southwestern university. Participants. Twenty-five obese adult women (mean body mass index [BMI] = 31.8 kg/m², standard deviation [SD] = 4.9). Intervention. Participants were asked to choose and adopt small changes in their diet and physical activity relative to baseline during weekly group-based meetings over 3 months. Participants then received bi-weekly phone calls across a 6-month follow-up period. Measures. Weight change was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included waist circumference, daily step count, and caloric intake. Analyses. Intention-to-treat analysis of change from baseline and completers-only analysis (n = 22) for secondary outcomes. Results. Participants achieved clinically significant weight loss (mean [M] = -3.2 kg, standard error [SE] = .47 kg, p < .001) across the initial small changes treatment program. Moreover, participants continued to lose weight across the 6-month phone-based follow-up program (M = -2.1 kg, SE = .83 kg, p < .017), totaling >5% weight loss across the 9-month program (M = 5.3 kg, SE = 1.1 kg, p < .001). Conclusion. Using a small changes approach, participants achieved weight loss in an initial group-based program, which continued with minimal phone-based follow-up. Larger randomized studies comparing a small changes approach to traditional obesity treatment are warranted. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine associations between pay for performance (P4P) and recommended cessation counseling among primary care practices (PCPs). Design. Cross-sectional survey of 89 PCPs participating in a joint Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)-Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) health promotion initiative. Setting and Participants. 100% response rate from PCPs participating in the RWJF-AHRQ initiative. Measures. Survey data on cessation counseling, practice involvement with P4P, practice size, public reporting of performance, practice competition, linkages with community resources, integration of evidence-based guidelines, patient recommendations for cessation, and state-specific smoking rates. Analysis. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between practice involvement with P4P and cessation counseling offered by PCPs. Practice characteristics, including size and availability of other cessation services, were included in the analysis. Results. Practices that were involved with P4P had greater odds of offering recommended cessation counseling (odds ratio [OR] = 27.6, p < .01). Practices that linked patients to community resources, experienced greater competition, and were larger in size also provided more counseling (p < .05). Publicly reporting performance information and being located in states with higher smoking rates were associated with decreased odds of offering counseling support (p < .10). Conclusions. Findings suggest that P4P is associated with recommended counseling for smoking cessation. Study limitations include small sample size and unavailability of information on the magnitude of P4P incentives and program design. Further analysis considering these programmatic details is warranted. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. We examined the influence of nativity and community context (Hispanic neighborhood concentration) on two measures of problem drinking among Mexican-Americans. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. Texas City Stress and Health Study conducted in Texas City, Texas during 2004-2006. Participants. A total of 1435 Mexican-Americans aged 25 years and older. Measures. Binge drinking (⩾6 drinks per occasion by men and ⩾4 drinks per occasion by women) and scoring positive on the CAGE (a four-item clinical measure of problem drinking) as dependent variables. Key independent variables included a measure of language acculturation, proportion of Hispanics in the participant's neighborhood according to 2000 U.S. Census data, and being foreign-born compared with being U.S.-born. Analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to predict being a binge drinker and being positive on the CAGE. Results. Foreign-born women were less likely to be binge drinkers than U.S.-born women. Nativity was not significant among men. Moreover women were less likely to be binge drinkers if they lived in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods. No such effect was found among men. Similar results were obtained with the CAGE. Conclusions. We found a powerful influence of nativity (being U.S.-born compared with foreign born) and neighborhood Hispanic concentration on problem drinking among women but not among men. It is likely that cultural norms in heavily Hispanic environments discourage problem drinking among women but not among men. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Young adult restaurant workers face the dual stressors of work adjustment and managing personal responsibilities. We assessed a new psychosocial/health promotion training designed to reduce these stressors in the context of restaurant work. Design. A cluster-randomized trial of a training program, with surveys administered approximately 2 weeks before training and both 6 and 12 months after training. Setting. A national restaurant chain. Subjects. A total of 947 restaurant workers in 28 restaurants. Measures. Personal stress, exposure to problem coworkers, and personal and job characteristics. Intervention. Team Resilience (TR) is an interactive program for stress management, teamwork, and work-life balance. TR focuses on "five Cs" of resilience: compassion, commitment, centering, community, and confidence. Analysis. Mixed-model (multilevel) analysis of covariances. Results. Compared with workers in control stores, workers in TR-trained stores showed significant reductions over time in exposure to problem coworkers (F[2, 80.60] = 4.48; p = .01) and in personal stress (F[2, 75.28] = 6.12; p = .003). Conclusion. The TR program may help young workers who face the challenges of emerging adulthood and work-life balance. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To assess the efficacy of an intervention to promote mammography and Papanicolaou (Pap) testing among women with mobility impairments overdue for screenings Design. Randomized controlled trial. Setting. Urban and suburban Oregon. Participants. Women aged 35 to 64 with mobility impairments who reported not receiving a Pap test in the past 3 years and/or mammogram (if age >40 years) in the last 2 years were eligible. A total of 211 women were randomized, and 156 completed the study (26% attrition). The majority were not employed and reported annual income <$10,000. Intervention. The Promoting Access to Health Services (PATHS) program is a 90-minute, small-group, participatory workshop with 6 months of structured telephone support, based on the health belief model and social cognitive theory. Measures. Perceived susceptibility to breast and cervical cancer, perceived benefits of and self-efficacy for screening, intention to be screened, and self-reported receipt of mammography and Pap testing. Analysis. Chi-square tests to examine the proportion of women obtaining screening; analysis of covariance to examine change in theoretical mediators. Results. The intervention group received more Pap tests than the control group at posttest (intervention 61%, control 27%, n = 71, p < .01). No significant group effect was observed for mammography (intervention 49%, control 42%, n = 125, p = .45). Conclusion. Findings indicate that the PATHS intervention promotes Pap testing but not mammography among women with mobility impairments. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The primary purpose of the current study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a hip hop dance intervention, Latin Active, among low-income Mexican-American adolescents. Mexican-descent adolescents tend to have disproportionate rates of low physical activity, overweight status, and obesity. Design. A 5-week intervention design with pretest and post-test self-report measures. Setting. Charter middle school (grades 6-9) health/science classes in a low-income neighborhood were the setting for the Latin Active intervention. Participants. Overall, 81 participants were recruited; 73 (n = 41, female; n = 32, male) provided active parental consent to complete pretest/post-test surveys. Intervention. The Latin Active program included 10 interactive 50-minute lessons that were delivered twice a week during science/health classes. The curriculum was created on the basis of Social Cognitive Theory, Critical Hip Hop Pedagogy, and feedback from key stakeholders. The lessons focused on increasing physical activity as well as neighborhood barriers. Measures. The self-report pretest (n = 73) and post-test (n = 56) surveys included measures for frequency of vigorous physical activity, self-efficacy, and neighborhood barriers. Analysis. Paired-sample t-test analyses were conducted to assess mean differences from pretest to post-test results for intervention outcomes by gender. Results. The Latin Active program (with 77% retention at post-test) significantly increased vigorous physical activity and dance (p < .05) and increased self-efficacy (p < .05) among girls, and it decreased perception of neighborhood barriers (p < .05) among boys. Conclusion. A hip hop physical activity program, Latin Active demonstrated preliminary efficacy to increase girl's vigorous physical activity and boy's perception of neighborhood barriers to physical activity. Future research will need to use a randomized, controlled design and investigate the effect of the program on measures of body mass index. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- The article focuses on the study of smoking cessation through financial incentives with reference to evaluation of evidence of ineffectiveness or absence of evidence. The study comprised of nine trials with the review of magnitude of the incentives and the results. A comparison of binomial proportions was done to examine several factors like increase in quit rate, sample size and power. The odd ratios were then calulated from these factors. It was observed that there were not sufficient statistics to detect differences in rate of smoking cessation near the minimum threshold of clinical importance as even doubling of rates could not be determined.

AB- The article focuses on several issues of the U.S. including the fiscal strength, income inequality, health care and tax policies. As the author stated, less tax has been collected by the federal government than expenditure. The expenses of war and military in the U.S. are more than the combination of 17 nations. The health and quality of life is being affected by the inequality of income. The inequality can be reduced in two ways. The pay differences can be minimized like in Japan and government-funded social programs can be increased like Sweden.

AB- Purpose. To describe how research evidence and non-research-based information are used in testimony and other legislative documents used in arguments for and against physical activity-related bills in Minnesota. Design. Content analysis Setting. Documents and oral testimony archived by the Minnesota State Legislature from 2007 to 2011. Subjects. Not applicable. Measures. A coding instrument was developed to measure descriptive features of materials (e.g., length, document type) and the presence or absence of certain types of research evidence and non-research-based information. Analysis. Frequencies of variables and measures of associations using Pearson %2 tests. Results. Over a third (36%) of the sample contained research evidence, and 88% of the sample contained non-research-based information. Compared to materials related to physical activity, materials related to built environment were significantly less likely to reference research evidence. Conclusion. Despite an abundance of evidence, research evidence was present in only about one-third of the sample. There may be opportunities during legislative discussions on the built environment for obesity-related data to help make the case for sound policies. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Faith-based institutions and organizations represent a longstanding yet underutilized resource for health promotion and disease prevention efforts. The White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, and its affiliated office within the Department of Health and Human Services, are the highest-profile markers of federal efforts, but most faith-health partnerships are not federally funded and date back many decades. Formal partnerships between the faith-based and public health sectors encompass activities in the fields of health behavior and health education, health policy and management, epidemiology and biostatistics, and environmental health. These, partnerships are instrumental for achieving both domestic and global health promotion priorities. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Design. cross-sectional survey with test-retest. Setting. Neighborhoods with various socioeconomic characteristics and walkability in San Diego, Boston, and Cincinnati. Participants. Parent-adolescent pairs (n = 171), and parents of children (n = 116). Response rate was 47% for Survey 1, and 69% were retained far SUrvey 2. Methods. Data analyses included test-retest reliability and internal consisteney for FSI), tests of differential functioning for measurement invariance, t-test for associations between FSD and demographic variables, and partial correlation for associations of FSD with physical activity, screen time, and BMI z score. Results. The FSD scale had moderate to substantial test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = .65-. 85) and excellent internal consistency (Cronbach á = .88-. 94). Measurement invariance was established across gender, race/ethnicity, and income. FSD was higher regarding younger children, females, nonwhites, and lower-income youth. FSD was positively associated with restrictive parental rules for playing outside (partial r = .28-.33), and negatively associated with children's outdoor physical activity in the neighborhood (partial r = — .27), but not associated with other measures of physical activity, screen time, or BMI z score. Conclusion. The new measure of FSD had good evidence of reliability and measurement invariance, but there were inconsistent associations of FSD with youth physical activity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The biggest challenge for corporate wellness initiatives is low rates of employee participation. We test whether a behavioral economic approach to incentive design (i.e., a lottery) is more effective than a direct economic payment of equivalent monetary value (i.e., a grocery gift certificate) in encouraging employees to complete health risk assessments (HRAs). Design. Employees were assigned to one of three arms. Assignment to a treatment arm versus the nontreatment arm was determined by management. Assignment to an arm among those eligible for treatment was randomized by office. Setting. A large health care management and information technology consulting company. Patients. A total of 1299 employees across 14 offices participated. Intervention. All employees were eligible to receive $25 for completing the NRA. Those in the lottery condition were assigned to teams offour to eight people and, conditional on NRA completion, were entered into a lottery with a prize of $100 (expected value, $25) and a bonus value of an additional $25 if 80% of team members participated. Those in the grocery gift certificate condition who completed an HRA received a $25 grocery gift certificate. Those in the comparison condition received no additional incentive. Measures. NRA completion rates. Analysis. Logistic regression analysis. Results. NRA completion rates were significantly higher among participations in the lottery incentive condition (64%) than in both the grocery gift certificate condition (44%) and the comparison condition (40%). Effects were larger for lower-income employees, as indicated by a significant interaction between income and the lottery incentive. Conclusion. Lottery incentives that incorporate regret aversion and social pressure can provide higher impact for the same amount of money as simple economic incentives. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Explore the importance of residential mobility and use of services outside neighborhoods when interventions targeting low-income families are planned and implemented. Design. Analysis of cross-sectional telephone household survey data on childhood mobility and school enrollment in four large distressed cities. Setting. Baltimore, Maryland; Detroit, Michigan; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Richmond, Virginia. Subjects. Total of 1723 teens aged 10 to 18 years and their parents. Measures. Continuous self-report of the number of years parents lived in the neighborhood of residence and city; self-report of whether the child attends school in their neighborhood; and categorical self report of parents' marital status, mother's education, parent race, family income, child's age, and child's sex. Analysis. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression. Results. In this sample, 85.2% of teens reported living in the city where they were born. However, only 44.4% of black teens lived in neighborhoods where they were born, compared with 59.2% of white teens. Although 50.3% of black teens attended schools outside of their current neighborhoods, only 31.4% of whites did. Residential mobility was more common among black than white children (odds ratio = 1.82; p <.001), and black teens had 43% lesser odds of attending school in their home communities. Conclusions. Mobility among low-income and minority families challenges some assumptions of neighborhood interventions premised on years of exposure to enriched services and changes in the built environment.

AB- Purpose. To evaluate whether influence from social network members is associated with motivation to change dietary and physical activity behaviors. Design. Baseline assessment followed by mailing of family health history—based personalized messages (2 weeks) and follow-up assessment (3 months). Setting. Families from an ongoing population-based cohort in Houston, Texas. Subjects. 475 adults from 161 Mexican-origin families. Out of 347 households contacted, 162 (47%) participated. Measures. Family health history, social networks, and motivation to change behaviors. Analysis. Two-level logistic regression modeling. Results. Having at least one network member who encourages one to eat more fruits and vegetables (p = .010) and to engage in regular physical activity (p = .046) was associated with motivation to change the relevant behavior. About 40% of the participants did not have encouragers for these behaviors. Conclusions. Identification of new encouragers within networks and targeting natural encouragers (e.g., children, spouses) may increase the efficacy of interventions to motivate behavioral changes among Mexican-origin adults.

AB- Purpose. To track changes in US. children's early weight status (normal, at-risk, or obese) from infancy through preschool. Design. Patterns of change in individual children's weight status are established using three time points from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study—Birth cohort. Setting. United States. Subjects. Nationally representative sample of US. preschool children surveyed at 9 months (n = 8900), with fellow-up at 2 years (n = 7500) and preschool (n = 7000). Measures. Individual children's weight status was determined from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts at multiple time periods. Analysis. Layered, categorical data analysis of changes in weight status patterns at three time periods during infancy through preschool. Results. Young children whose early weight status was normal tend to retain a normal weight status and not to develop an unfavorable status (at-risk, obese). In contrast, children who were obese at an early age were more likely to have an at-risk or obese weight category at a later age. Overall, both favorable and unfavorable early weight statuses were highly associated with subsequent status at preschool. Conclusion. Early weight status can provide important information relevant for early entry point prevention and treatment of childhood obesity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To characterize the presence of advocacy groups in media coverage about tobacco issues. Design. A content analysis of tobacco-related newspaper articles. Setting. Australia. Sample. All 12 national and state capital daily newspapers published in Australia between 2004 and 2007. Measures. We coded each article for explicit mentions of any of 16 major national or state tobacco control advocacy groups; for the article type, prominence, and topic; for the tone of the event; and for the author's opinion. Analysis. A series of 2 × 2 x² analyses assessed the extent to which advocacy groups were more or less likely to be mentioned in articles of each type, prominence, topic, event impact, and opinion orientation. Results. Of the 4387 tobacco-related articles published over this period, 22% mentioned an advocacy group. There was a greater-than-expected proportion of advocacy groups mentioned in news articles with very high prominence (44%; x² [1, N = 3118] = 27.4, p < .001), high prominence (34%; x² [1, N = 3118J = 10.9, p < .001), and medium prominence (30%; x² [1, N= 3118] = 7.3, p = .007), and in articles covering events with mixed (30%; x² [1, N = 4387] = 10.0, p = .002) or positive (24%; x² [1, N = 43871 = 26.1, p <.001)implications for tobacco control. Conclusions. Australian tobacco control advocacy groups have a reasonable presence within the news discourse on tobacco control issues and so are likely to contribute to generating and shaping this discourse, particularly in relation to evolving and controversial issues.

To determine if an existing ballroom dance classroom program meets national recommendations to engage children in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for ≥ 50% of class time and to determine class effects on body mass index (BMJ). Design. Prospective descriptive study. Setting. Two New York City public schools. Participants. Seventy-nine fourth and fifth grade students. Measurements. The System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time (SOFIT) and direct heart rate monitoring were used to determine participants' MVPA levels during class time. Weight and height were measured to calculate BMI. Analysis. Means were calculated for continuous variables; frequency counts and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. Change in BMI percentiles was assessed by using Bhapkar's x2 test of overall marginal homogeneity. Results. Data from SOFIT observations showed that a mean of 50.0% and 67.0% of class time in the first and second halves of the program, respectively, were spent in MVPA. Data from the heart rate monitoring revealed that 71.1 % of students were at ≥ 25% heart rate reserve, which indicated MVPA for ≥ 50% of class time. Improvement was seen in BMI percentile (p = .0651). Conclusion. Ballroom dance provides MVPA in elementary school children for ≥ 50% of class time and has a positive impact on BMI percentiles.

AB- Purpose. Descriptive physical activity epidemiology of the U.S. population is critical for program development and resource allocation. The purpose of this project was to describe step-defined categories (as measured by accelerometer) of US. adults and to determine predictors of sedentary classification (<5000 steps/d). Design. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHAIVES) is an annual nationally representative survey used to determine the health status of the US. populace. Setting. In-home interviews and physical examination components of NHANES. Participants. Overall, 4372 eligible adults wore accelerometers in the 2005-2006 NHANES; 628 were excluded, which yielded 3744 adults (of which 46.8% were men). Measures. Steps per day; body mass index (BMI,); demographic, household and behavioral variables. Analysis. Means and frequencies were calculated. Logistic regression was utilized to determine predictors of sedentary classification. Results. Overall, 36.1 % were sedentary (i.e., <5000 steps/d); 47.6% were low to somewhat active (5000-9999 steps/d); 16.3% were active to highly active (≥ 10,000 steps/d). Advancing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.95; confidence intervals [CIs], 1.78, 2.13), higher BMI (OR, 1.40; CIs, 1.23, 1.59), female sex (OR, 1.86; CIs, 1.46, 2.36), African-American versus European-American ethnicity (OR, 1.36; CIs, 1.13, 1.65), household income versus ≥ $45,000 (<$25,000: OR, 1.94; CIs, 1.40, 2.69; $25,000-$44,000: OR, 1.51; CIs, 1.23, 1.85), and current versus never smoker (OR, 1.53; CIs, 1.26, 1.86) variables had higher odds of sedentary classification. Usual daily occupational/domestic physical activity categories of standing/walking (OR, .51; CIs, .38, .69); lifting/climbing (OR, .26; CIs, .17, .38); and heavy loads/labor (OR, .16; CIs, .10, .26) had lower odds ofsedentary classification than sitting. Conclusions. Over one-third of the U.S. population was classified as sedentary by accelerometer-determined steps per day, and several characteristics predicted sedentary classification.

AB- Purpose. Despite the well-established benefits of physical activity (PA), most Americans, especially those in rural, traditionally underserved areas, engage in considerably less PA than recommended. This study examines perceived barriers to and facilitators of PA and promising organized PA programs among rural Appalachians. Design. Eight focus groups and seven group key informant interviews were conducted. Setting. This study was conducted in eastern Kentucky, in central Appalachia. Subjects. One hundred and fourteen rural Appalachian residents (74% female, 91 % white) participated. Measures. Open-ended, semistructured, and structured questions regarding perceptions of barriers to/facilitators of and examples of successful/failed PA programs were asked. Analysis. Qualitative data analysis was conducted, including codebook development and steps taken to ensure rigor and transferability. Interrater reliability was over 94 %. Results. In addition to barriers that are consistent with those found in other populations, rural Appalachian residents indicated that travel time, family commitments, and inadequate community resources undermine PA. Suggested avenues to increase PA include partnership with churches and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service; programs that include families, are well advertised, and focus on health rather than appearance; and, underlying all suggestions, culturally relevant yet nonstereotyping activities. Conclusions. When developing PA interventions in rural Appalachia, it is important to employ community-based participatory approaches that leverage unique assets of the population and show potential in overcoming challenges to PA.

AB- Purpose. To use Ecological Momentary Assessment with mobile phones to describe where and with whom children's leisure-time physical activity occurs. Design. Repeated assessments across 4 days (Friday—Monday) during nonschool time (20 total). Setting. Chino, California, and surrounding communities. Subjects. Primarily low to middle income children (N = 121; aged 9-13 years; x = 11.0 years, SD = 1.2 years; 52% male, 38% Hispanic/Latino). Measures. Electronic surveys measured current activity (e.g., active play /sports/exercise, watching TV/movies), social company (e.g., family, friends, alone), physical location (e.g., home, outdoors, school), and other perceived contextual features (e.g., safety, traffic, vegetation, distance from home). Analysis. Multilevel linear and multinomial logistic regression. Results. Most of children's physical activity occurred outdoors (away from home) (42%), followed by at home (indoors) (30%), front/backyard (at home) (8%), someone else's house (8%), at a gym/recreation center (3%), and other locations (9%). Children's physical activity took place most often with multiple categories ofpeople together (e.g., friends and family) (39%), followed by family members only (32%), alone (15%), and with friends only (13%). Age, weight status, income, and racial/ ethnic differences in physical activity contexts were observed. Conclusions. The most frequently reported contexts for children's leisure time physical activity were outdoors and with family members and friends together. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine the relationship between the presence of smokers in the workplace and smokers in the home and current smoking status among employed men and women. Design. Analysis of data from the second wave of the nationally representative Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (2004-2006). Subjects. Sample of 627 currently employed men and women, aged 34 to 82 (M= 51), who had been regular cigarette smokers at some time. Measures. Survey items indexing presence of smokers in the respondents' immediate work area and home and their current smoking status. Analysis. Multiple logistic regression analyses, controlling for age, gender, education, race, and job type. Results. Examined together, smokers in the workplace (0R= 2.83) and smokers in the home (0R = 6.09) were uniquely associated with current smoking status. Moreover, smokers in the home reduced the association between smokers in the workplace and current smoking. The presence of smokers in the workplace was associated with « more than fourfold increase in current smoking among respondents with no smokers in the home, but was unrelated to current smoking among respondents with smokers in the home. Conclusions. Failure to consider the presence of smokers in the home significantly limits the potential impact of workplace smoking interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Assessing food environments often requires using commercially available data. Disparate methods used for classifying food outlets in these databases call for creating a classification approach using common definitions. A systematic strategy for reclassifying food stores and restaurants, as they appear in commercial databases, into categories that differentiate the availability of healthy options is described here. Design and Setting. Commercially available data on food outlets including names, addresses, North American Industry Classification System codes, and associated characteristics was obtained for five New Jersey communities. Analysis. A reclassification methodology was developed using criteria and definitions from the literature to categorize food outlets based on availability of healthy options. Information in the database was supplemented by systematic Internet and key word searches, and from phone calls to food outlets. Results. The methodology resulted in 622 supermarket/grocery stores, 183 convenience stores, and 148 specialty stores in the original data to be reclassified into 58 supermarkets, 30 grocery stores, 692 convenience stores, and 115 specialty stores. Outlets from the original list of 1485 full-service restaurants and 506 limited-service restaurants were reclassified as 563 full- service restaurants and 1247 limited-service restaurants. Reclassification resulted in less than one-seventh the number of supermarkets and grocery stores, more than three times the number of convenience stores, and twice as many limited-service restaurants'a much less healthy profile than the one generated by using exclusively the commercial databases. Conclusion. An explicit and replicable strategy is proposed for reclassifying food outlets in commercial databases into categories that differentiate on the basis of healthy food availability. The intent is to contribute towards building a consensus among researchers on definitions used in public health research for characterizing different types offood outlets. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study examines whether local income inequality is associated with an increased likelihood of obesity among Los Angeles County residents and whether collective efficacy mediates the relationship. Design. A cross-sectional study of 2825 adults in 65 neighborhoods that took part in wave 1 of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey in 2000-2001. Neighborhood measures are taken from the Los Angeles Neighborhood Services and Characteristics Database and decennial census. Measures. Obesity is defined as a body mass index over 30. Income inequality is operationalized with the Gini coefficient. Collective efficacy is a neighborhood-level measure comprised of aggregated responses to items that capture trust, cohesion, and the willingness to intervene for the common good among residents. Controls are included at the individual level for demographics and health characteristics, and at the neighborhood level for median household income. Analysis. Logistic regression models of individuals within neighborhoods. Results. When neighborhood economic well-being is controlled, income inequality is associated with a significant reduction in the likelihood of obesity while also controlling for individual demographic and health-related characteristics. Collective efficacy exerts an independent and beneficial effect but does not mediate the relationship between inequality and obesity. Gonclusion. Neighborhood social resources and economic heterogeneity are associated with a lower likelihood of obesity. It may be that economically heterogeneous neighborhoods, perhaps especially in Los Angeles County, contain characteristics that promote health. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Puspose. The population of military veterans attending college is rapidly growing as veterans return from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). We sought to describe patterns of student veterans' health-related behaviors and how they might differ from their nonveteran peers. Design. We analyzed data from the 2008 Boynton College Student Health Suwey (CSHS). Setting. CSHS participants completed an anonymous online survey. Subjects. The CSHS sampled students (n = 8651) attending public, private, 2-year, and 4-year postsecondasy educational institutions in Minnesota. Measures. The CSHS included items on substance use (including alcohol and tobacco), safety, nutrition, and physical activity. Analysis. We described demographics of OFF/DIE veteran, non-veteran, and nonveteran students and used Poisson regression to compute adjusted relative risks (ARRs) with 95% confidence intervak (CIs) to characterize associations between veteran status and health behaviors. Results. After controlling for demographics, veteran students reported more safety, tobacco-, and alcohol-related risk behaviors compared to nonveteran students. For instance, compared to the nonveteran reference group, the ARR for past year smokeless tobacco use and physicalfighting among for DEE/OIF veterans was 1.76 (95% CI = 1.31—2.35) and 1.48(95% [c;11]= 1.22—1.79) respectively. Veteran and nonveteran students display similar weight-related behaviors, though OEF/ Oveteran students were more likely to engage in strengthening exercises. Conclusions. There are specific health risk behaviors that are particularly relevant for veterans attending postsecondary institutions. As veterans enroll in postsecondary education, there is a unique window of opportunity for health promotion in this population. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To assess the evolution of perceived ownership of a university-Aboriginal community partnership across three project stages. Design. Survey administration to project partners during project formalization (1996—Ti), mobilization (1999—T2), and maintenance (2004—T3). Setting. Aboriginal community of Kahnawake, outside Montrea4 Qaebec, Canada. Participants. Partners involved in influencing decision making in the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project (KSTDPP). Measure and Analysis. A measure of perceived primaiy ownership subjected to linear trend analysis. Results. KSDPP staff were perceived as primary owner at TI and shared ownership with Community Advisory Board (CAB) members at T2 and T3. Trend tests indicated greater perceived ownership between TI and T3 for CAB (X21 = 12.3, p <.0001) and declining KSDPP staff (X21 = 10.5, p <.001) ownership over time. Academic partners were never perceived as primary owners. Conclusion. This project was community driven from the beginning It was not dependent on an external academic change agent to activate the community and develop the community's capacity to plan and implement a solution. It still took several years for the grassroots CAB to take responsibility from KSDPP staff thus indicating the need for sustained funding to build grassroots community capacity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Investigate relations between demographic characteristics and submission method, Internet or paper, when physical activity behaviors are reported. Design. Observational. Setting. Metropolitan. Subjects. Adult women (N = 918) observed weekly for 2 years (total number of weekly reports, 44,963). Measures. Independent variables included age, race, education, income, employment status, and Internet skills. Dependent variables were method of submission (Internet or paper) and adherence. Analysis. Logistic regression to analyze weekly odds of submitting data online and meeting study adherence criteria. Model 1 investigated method of submission, model 2 analyzed meeting study's Internet adherence, and model 3 analyzed meeting total adherence regardless of submission method. Results. Whites, those with good Internet skills, and those reporting higher incomes were more likely to log online. Those who were white older, and reported good Internet skills were more likely to be at least 75% adherent online. Older women were more likely to be adherent regardless of method. Employed women were less likely to log online or be adherent. Conclusion. Providing participants with multiple submission methods may reduce potential bias and provide mare generalizable results relevant for future Internet-based research. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the efficacy of a computer-tailored intervention (CTI) based on the transtheoretical model (TTM) for reducing depression, an increasingly important component of health promotion programs. Design. Pretest-posttest randomized trial. Setting. Participants were recruited and treated at home after being identified in two primary care clinics in Eastern Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois. Subjects. A total of 350 adults experiencing at least mild symptoms of depression but not involved in or planning to seek treatment for depression. Intervention. A print manual and three CTI reports tailored to stage of change for using effective methods to prevent or reduce depression, other TTM variables, level of depression, and behavior. Measures. Pre-post changes and reliable and clinically significant change on the Beck Depression scale II and pre-post changes on the 20-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form survey-based measure of physi cal functioning at 9 months' follow-up. Analysis. t-tests and x2 tests. Complete-case analysis and two intention-to-treat analyses-assumption of no change and multiple imputation (MI)-are reported. Exploratory analyses examined whether the effects of the intervention on depression were moderated by five subject characteristics: baseline level of depression, baseline level of physical functioning, baseline stage of change for preventing or managing depression, age, and education. Results. Complete-case and intention-to-treat analyses showed that the intervention group experienced significantly greater improvements in depression (d .220-355); results for physical functioning were weaker (d .150-.309) and did not reach statistical significance in the MI analysis. The effects of the intervention on reliable and clinically significant change in depression were largest among participants who were experiencing moderate depression (d = .363-.519) or severe depression (d = .603-.718) or who were in the precontemplation or contemplation stage (d = .573-.856) at baseline.

Particular focus is given to the potential for SNS to promote self-regulation in the areas of individual lifestyle and behavioral changes. SNS give people access to self-monitoring and goal-setting tools. They provide social support and social networking capabilities to people seeking to improve their health while improving one's self-efficacy. Problems with SNS-use for health promotion include the protection of health information, privacy, and cyberbullying.

AB- Purpose. To determine whether the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique can affect the physician costs of consistently high-cost people. Design. Quasi-experimental, longitudinal, cost-minimization evaluation. This 14-year, preinteroention-postintervention study retrospectively assessed government payments to physicians for treating the TM and no-treatment (NT) groups. Setting. Province of Quebec, Canada. Participants. The highest-spending 10% of 1418 Quebec health insurance enrollees who practiced the TM technique were compared with the highest 10% of 1418 subjects who were randomly selected from enrollees of the same age, sex, and region. TM participants had chosen to begin the technique prior to choosing to enter the study. Measures. Annual payments to private physicians in all treatment settings. The Quebec government health insurance agency provided the total physician payments for each of the 2836 subjects from 1981 to 1994. Other medical expense data for individuals were unavailable. Data were adjusted for medical cost inflation. Analysis. For each subject, least-squares regression slopes were calculated to estimate preintervention and postintervention annual rates of change in payments. The groups' means, slopes,, and medians were compared using both parametric and nonparametric tests. Results. Before starting meditation, the yearly rate of increase in payments to physicians between groups was not significantly different. After commencing meditation, the TM group's mean payments declined $44.93 annually (p = .004), whereas the NT comparison group's payments exhibited nonsignificant changes. After 1 year; the TM group decreased 11 %, and after 5 years their cumulative reduction was 28% (p .001). Conclusions. The results suggest the intervention may be an effective method for reducing physician costs. Randomized studies are recommended. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine associations between county-level natural amenities, physical activity (PA), and body mass index (BMI). Design and Setting. Cross-sectional study among 100 North Carolina counties. Measures. We obtained percentage of county residents meeting PA criteria and county-wide means for reported height and weight from the North Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, combining years 2003, 2005, and 2007. The county natural amenities scale was the independent variable. Potential county-level covariates were percentage rural, percentage black, median age, and median household income (Census 2000). Analysis. We conducted weighted bivariate and linear regression analyses to examine relationships between natural amenities, aggregate PA, and aggregate BMI. Results. BMJ and natural amenities were negatively associated (parameter estimate = - .13 (.06), p = .03). When percentage. meeting PA criteria was included, the parameter estimate attenuated 15%. Conclusion. There was an inverse relationship between natural amenities and BMI, partially mediated by PA. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine if a mass media campaign influenced walking differently in people in different physical environments. Design. Quasi-experimental study. Setting. Wheeling, West Virginia. Participants. Random sample of adults age 50 to 65 years, response rate: 72.1 % (n = 719 in intervention community, n = 753 in comparison community). Intervention. Mass media campaign. Measures. Self-reported measures were used in before and after telephone surveys for walking and the physical environment. Measures included 11 environmental walkability items, from which two subscales (i.e., usable sidewalks/aesthetics and facilities) were extracted. Analysis. Multiple linear regression. Results. Overall, walking increased by 2.7 minutes per week (standard deviation [SD] 231.1, not significant [NS]). When confined to those insufficiently active at baseline (i.e., <30 minutes per day) the minutes walked increased by 92.1 minutes (SD = 152.9, p <.001). For the insufficiently active at baseline in the top half of the environmental factor of usable sidewalks, walking increased by 19 minutes more than in the bottom half (NS). For the factor of aesthetics and facilities, people in the more walkable environment increased walking by 87 minutes more than those in the bottom half (p <.001). Conclusion. In this community-wide physical activity, intervention changes in walking after the campaign were significantly moderated by some environmental attributes. This contributes to the limited evidence on the impact of the environment in enhancing community physical activity interventions. This finding needs to be replicated in other community interventions with greater environmental variation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. In most states, smoking has been curtailed to some extent in public buildings, workplaces, and restaurants. The next frontier for smoke-free policies is the multiunit dwelling industiy. However, the extent to which smoke-free housing currently is available is unknown. The purpose of this study was to measure the market for smoke-free housing in Virginia and to identify barriers to adapting smoke-free policies. Design. Telephone interviews were conducted with property managers of rental apartments, townhouses, senior housing, and public housing in four Virginia cities. Setting. Four cities in Virginia. Subjects. Two hundred sixty-three property managers in four cities in Virginia (approximately 75 property managers per city). Measures. Property managers were administered a brief telephone survey. Results. Only 33.8% of property managers reported some type of smoke-free policy, with only 15% of those policies prohibiting smoking in residential units. Most property managers without a smoke-free policy were not considering adopting such a policy for a variety of reasons. Conclusion. The availability of smoke-free multiunit dwellings is severely lacking. This study identified a number of science-based and legal misperceptions that may prevent the adoption of smoke-free policies. Correction of these misperceptions is warranted to increase the availability of smoke-free housing. Such policies will be useful in creating environments that support good health practices while simultaneously protecting tenants from exposure to secondhand smoke. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the association of work and home smoking bans with quitting behaviors among employed female smokers in the United States. Design. Secondary analyses using cross-sectional data from the 2006/200 7 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Subjects. Nationally representative sample of 7610 US. employed female smokers, aged 18 to 64 years, who reported working indoors. Setting. N/A. Methods. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association of smoking ban policies (complete work and home bans, complete work ban only, complete home ban only, and no complete work or home ban) with intention to quit in the next 30 days, at least one quit attempt in the past year, and sustained abstinence of at least 3 months in the past year. Results. Twenty-nine percent of women reported complete work and home smoking bans. Smoking bans were not associated with intention to quit and were marginally associated with sustained abstinence. Regardless of intention to quit, women with complete work and home bans were significantly more likely than those without complete work and home bans to report quit attempts. Among women with no intention to quit, the odds of having a quit attempt were significantly higher among women who had a complete home ban only compared with women without complete work and home bans. Conclusions. Efforts to promote quitting behaviors among employed female smokers may be facilitated by increasing rates of complete smoking bans at both work and home settings. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the relationship between stress level and quality of life at a worksite weliness center. Design. A survey completed when joining the wellness center. Setting. Employee wellness center. Subjects. Survey that inquired about stress, health behaviors, and quality of life of more than 13,000 employees joining a wellness center. Measures. A series of questions about current health status and health behaviors. Analysis. Two-sample t-tests assuming unequal variances. Results. A total of 2147 of these employees reported having high stress levels. Employees with high stress levels had statistically sigruficant lower quality of life, more fatigue, and poorer health compared with employees with low stress levels. In terms of their ability and motivation to participate in weilness programs, the high-stress employees were also less active and had less healthy nutritional habits, less support, and less confidence in their ability to be active. They also reported having more health problems, including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and overweight. Conclusions. It appears that employees with high stress levels-those who might most benefit from participation in wellness programs-may experience the greatest difficulty participating actively in wellness programs because of their lack of support, low confidence, and numerous health problems. Perhaps offering tailored stress reduction programs for these employees would be beneficial. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Assess the effectiveness of the integration of vegetable demonstration videos and tasting experiences into a college nutrition course to influence students'. readiness to change vegetable intake, self-efficacy for vegetable preparation, and usual vegetable intake. Design. Quasiexperimental, preintervention-postinteruention comparisons. Setting. College nutrition course. Subjects. Of the 376 students enrolled in the course, 186 completed the online assessments (145 female, 41 male; mean age, 20 years). Intervention. Participants viewed online vegetable preparation videos and participated in vegetable tasting experiences that featured four target vegetables, one vegetable each month for 4 months. Measures. Preinteruention and postintervention online surveys determined usual vegetable intake, readiness to change vegetable consumption, and self-efficacy of vegetable preparation. Analysis. Chisqu are distribution and paired sample t-tests were used to examine differences preinteruention and postintervention. Results. Stage of readiness to change vegetable intake shifted from contemplation toward preparation (p <.001). Self-efficacy of vegetable preparation increased and postintervention self-efficacy was associated with total and target vegetable consumption (p = .001 and p = .005, respectively). The average intake of asparagus, one of four target vegetables, increased (p = .016); similar changes were not observed for target or total vegetable consumption. Conclusion. Online vegetable demonstration videos may be an effective and cost-efficient intervention for increasing self-efficacy of vegetable preparation and readiness to increase vegetable consumption among college students. More research is needed to determine long-term effects on vegetable consumption. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine food system experts' explanations for the consistently low level offruit and vegetable consumption in Australia and what can be done to increase it. Design. A qualitative survey offood system experts. Setting. The survey was administered online to experts across Australia between August and November 2008 using Survey Monkey. corn. Subjects. Key informants (N = 332) in sectors ranging from farming through food waste disposal; 122 usable responses were analyzed. Measures. Opinions about fruit and vegetable consumption were collected through open ended questions. Respondent background information was also collected. Analysis. Identification of key themes via qualitative analysis. Results. Many reasons for inadequate consumption were suggested, most of which related to inadequacies in the supply offruit and vegetables. However, the most commonly cited solutions focused on increasing consumer demand. Conclusion. The incongruence between reasons for inadequate consumption and proposed solutions presents a challenge and suggests a need to shift policy priorities towards improving the supply of fruit and vegetables. Several well-coordinated approaches between the various sectors are needed to maximize outcomes. They include some outside the scope of traditional health promotion efforts. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Prophylactic vaccination programs in conjunction with cervical screening can significantly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer worldwide. This study tested the hypothesis that human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination can adversely affect adherence to cervical screening if the public develops the misconception that the HPV vaccination has removed the need for screening. Design. A postal survey using a stratified random sample was employed. Participants. Overall, 500 medical students and 500 nonmedical students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki were invited to participate. The response rate was 82%. Measures. A questionnaire was developed assessing demographic characteristics, adherence to cervical screening, and awareness and attitudes toward HPV. Analysic. Logistic regression was used to assess the impact of HPV awareness and attitudes towards HPV vaccination on adherence to Papanicolaou screening, controlling for place of origin and mother's screening behavior. Results. Students who believed that vaccination against HPV obviated the need for a Papanicolaou test were two times less likely to adhere to cervical screening (adjusted odds ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-2.57; p = .0004). The effect was stronger in the nonmedical subgroup (adjusted odds ratio, 3.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-5.160; p = .0003). Conclusion. Findings highlight that misconceptions can adversely affect preventive behaviors and reduce the probability of an early diagnosis of cervical cancer. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the effects of a multicomponent intervention on stair usage. Design. Nonrandomized controlled intervention. Setting. Two multistory university dormitories. Subjects. Total of 5711 direct observations of university dormitory residents. Intervention. The 2-week "Step It UP" intervention used poster prompts and fun/ competitive challenges with incentives to encourage residents to take the stairs instead of the elevators. Measures. Ascending stair and elevator use was directly observed and coded for gender at high traffic times in intervention and control dormitories for 14 nonconsecutive hours over 1 week each at baseline, midintervention, and 1 week postintervention. Analysis. The proportions of ascending stair and elevator users were compared using X² analyses. Results. Baseline stair use was equal between intervention and control dormitories (24.9% and 27.8%, respectively; X²[1, N = 1849] = .08; p = .77). Stair use significantly increased from baseline in the intervention dormitory to 33.24% (X²[1, N = 2192] = 18.44; p <.001) compared with no change in the control. Stair use returned to baseline in the intervention dormitory at postintervention (25.4%; X²[1, N = 2297] = .08; p = .78). There were no significant differences between genders. Conclusion. This multicomponent, short-duration intervention significantly increased stair usage in a university dormitory relative to the control but was unable to sustain the increase when prompts were removed. Campaigns to sustain stair use are needed. Formative assessment is required to determine what combinations of components may yield the most cost-effective approach forfuture interventions.

AB- Purpose. To evaluate the implementation of intervention components of the Louisiana Health study, which was a multicomponent childhood obesity prevention program conducted in rural schools. Design. Content analysis. Setting. Process evaluation assessed implementation in classrooms, gym classes, and cafeterias. Subjects. Classroom teachers (n = 232), physical education teachers (n = 53), food service managers (n = 33), and trained observers (n = 9). Measures. Five process evaluation measures were created: Physical Education Questionnaire (PEQ), Intervention Questionnaire (IQ), Food Service Manager Questionnaire (FSMQ), Classroom Observation (CO), and School Nutrition Environment Observation (SNEO). Analysis. Interrater reliability and internal consistency were assessed on all measures. Analysis of variance and X2 were used to compare differences across study groups on questionnaires and observations. Results. The PEQ and one subscale from the FSMQ were eliminated because their reliability coefficients fell below acceptable standards. The subscale internal consistencies for the IQ FSMQ, CO, and SNEO (all Cronbach α > .60) were acceptable. Conclusions. After the initial 4 months of intervention, there was evidence that the Louisiana Health intervention was being implemented as it was designed. In summary, four process evaluation measures were found to be sufficiently reliable and valid for assessing the delivery of various aspects of a school-based obesity prevention program. These process measures could be modified to evaluate the delivery of other similar school-based interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To describe differences in physical activity in the context of clustering patterns of health-promoting behaviors. Design. A cross-sectional study with 1724 participants (response rate, 91.1 %). Setting. Tadami Town, in a rural area of Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Subjects. Part of the general population who participated in annual health checkups (age range, 30-93 years). Measures. The Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II was used to assess frequency of health-promoting behaviors (physical activity, health responsibility, spiritual growth, interpersonal relationships, nutrition, and stress management). Smoking status, alcohol consumption, and disease status were self-reported. Public health nurses measured the weight and height of participants. Analysis. Cluster analysis was conducted to identify clustering patterns of health-promoting behaviors other than physical activity. Differences in physical activity between identified clusters were examined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Results. Four clusters were identified and labeled as "Most challenged" (20.4%), "Adherence to norms" (30.3%), "Well in mentality" (20.9%), and "Health-promoting" (28.4%). "Health-promoting" was the most physically active cluster, followed by "Adherence to norms" and "Well in mentality." Conclusions. Although the survey methodology was subject to selection, self-report, and recall biases, we have described physical activity in the context of clustering patterns of health- promoting behaviors. Laying the groundwork for physical activity in the lifestyle is important for establishing health-promotion strategies to increase physical activity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To document the prevalence of obese Mexican-Americans never advised by health professionals regarding exercise and diet, and to determine risk factors for no advice. Methods. Data came from 1787 obese Mexican-American adults (body mass index ≥ 30; age ≥ 18 years) in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The survey included self-reported receipt of health care provider advice on exercise and diet as well as sociodemographic, health-related, and provider-related factors. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed separately for advice regarding exercise and advice regarding diet. Results. Overall, 45% of respondents reported that they had never received advice from a doctor or health care professional to exercise more, and 52% reported that they have received advice to eat fewer higher-fat/high-cholesterol foods. Men, nonmarried respondents, lower- educated respondents, those who preferred to speak Spanish at home, and those without comorbid chronic conditions were less likely to receive advice. Discussion. Results suggest that obese Mexican-Americans are insufficiently advised by health care providers regarding exercise and diet. Given the seriousness of obesity- related health risks and the increasing prevalence of overweight status and obesity among Mexican-Americans, it is vital that providers are involved in finding ways to effectively educate and/or treat overweight patients.

AB- Purpose. Evaluate counselors' adherence to an intervention protocol, counselors' competence, and the associations between three process indicators and body weight at follow-up in a 6-month individually based lifestyle intervention for construction workers. Design. Process evaluation with qualitative and quantitative data. Setting. Occupational health service. Subjects. A total of 408 male construction workers with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease received the intervention, and 27 occupational health professionals delivered the intervention. Intervention. Seven counseling sessions, the first during which four prescribed items had to be discussed. Motivational interviewing (Ml) was used as a counseling technique. Measures and Analysis. The number of sessions and the items discussed were registered by the counselors. Adherence to MI was determined by expert scoring of transcripts of random segments of 19 counseling sessions. Counselors' competence was rated by participants and counselors separately. Associations between three process indicators and body weight at follow-up were determined by linear and logistic regression analyses. Results. Two-thirds of all participants attended five or more sessions, and 38.5% attended all seven sessions. In 90.2% of all cases, the counselor discussed all obligatory items in the first session. MI adherence was reached in one audiotaped fragment. Most (86.3%) of all participants agreed with the counselor being competent. Neither counselors' competence nor number of sessions or items discussed was significantly associated with body weight Conclusions. Performing five sessions and discussing four prescribed items was feasible for the counselors, whereas performing MI was not. Still, participants were positive about the counselors' competence and willing to attend the intervention sessions. Investigators are encouraged to report the evaluation of their intervention process to improve future lifestyle interventions in research or in practice. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Smoking prevalence among Medicaid enrollees is higher than among the general population, but use of evidence-based cessation treatment is low. We evaluated whether a communications campaign improved cessation treatment utilization. Design. Quasi-experimental. Setting. Wisconsin. Subjects. Enrollees in the Wisconsin Family Medicaid program. The average monthly enrollment during the study period was approximately 170,000 individuals. Intervention. Print materials for clinicians and consumers distributed to 13 health maintenance organizations (HMOs) serving Wisconsin Medicaid HMO enrollees. Measures. Wisconsin Medicaid pharmacy claims data for smoking cessation medications were analyzed before and after a targeted communications campaign. HMO enrollees were the intervention group. Fee-for-service enrollees were a quasi-experimental comparison group. Quit Line utilization data were also analyzed. Analysis. Pharmacotherapy claims and number of registered Quit Line callers were compared precampaign and postcampaign. Results. Precampaign, cessation pharmacotherapy claims declined for the intervention group and increased slightly for the comparison group (t = 2.29, p = .03). Postcampaign, claims increased in both groups. However, the rate of increase in the intervention group was significantly greater than in the comparison group (t = -2.2, p .04). A statistically significant increase was also seen in the average monthly number of Medicaid enrollees that registered for Quit Line services postcampaign compared to precampaign (F [1,22] = 7.19, p = .01). Conclusion. This natural experiment demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both pharmacotherapy claims and Quit Line registrations among Medicaid enrollees. These findings may help inform other states' efforts to improve cessation treatment utilization. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine the association between income level and variations in knowledge and perceptions about tobacco smoking in Morocco. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. Random sample of 9195 subjects representative of the Moroccan population. Subjects. Subjects aged >15 years from households. Measures. Data were collected from selected households using a standardized questionnaire about smoking, educational level, household monthly income, and knowledge of health effects of smoking. Analysis. Stepwise logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. Adjusted odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals for each variable were calculated as an estimate of the likelihood of having knowledge that smoking causes selected diseases. Results. Among 9195 subjects, 27.8% reported low income (<2000 Moroccan dirhams [MAD]), and 9.9% reported the highest income level (≥ 6000 MAD). Higher income was significantly associated with higher knowledge of health effects of smoking (p <. .0001); 55% of low-income respondents compared to 71.5% of respondents with higher income knew about the relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer. Conclusions. Lower income level was associated with lower awareness of the harms of smoking. There is a need to improve knowledge of the dangers of smoking among the disadvantaged segments of the population. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose: To determine the prevalence and predictors of the awareness of cigarette price increases following a cigarette tax increase, and assess the association of the tax increase and attempts to quit and reduce smoking among adolescents and young adults. Design: We used a prospective cohort design. Setting: Surveys were conducted in Minnesota before and after a $0.75 cigarette tax increase. Subjects: We surveyed 3167 adolescents and young adults, including a subsample of 781 past-30-day smokers. Measures: Outcome measures were awareness of cigarette price increases and among past- 30-day smokers, reported changes in smoking behaviors because of the tax increase. Predictors included demographics, social factors, and prior smoking behaviors. Analysis: We estimated the prevalence of the outcomes and their associations with the predictors using logistic regression. Results: Among all participants, 42% noticed an increase in cigarette prices after the tax increase, including 76% of past-30-day smokers. Being a heavier smoker, living with smokers, having more smoking close friends, and generally being aware of cigarette price changes prospectively predicted the awareness of the price increase after the tax increase. Among past-30-day smokers, 16.7% reported quit attempts and 24.1 % reported reducing smoking because of the tax increase. Conclusion: Because fewer than half of the participants noticed the cigarette tax increase, media campaigns to raise awareness of tax changes may increase their effectiveness. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the effectiveness of a community-based, multimedia intervention on medication adherence among hypertensive adults. Design. Randomized controlled trial. Setting. Rural south Alabama. Subjects. Low-income adults (N = 434) receiving medication at no charge from a public health department or a Federally Qualified Health Center. Intervention. Both interventions were home-based and delivered via computer by a community health advisor. The adherence promotion (AP) intervention focused on theoretical variables related to adherence (e.g., barriers, decisional balance, and role models). The cancer control condition received general cancer information. Measures. Adherence was assessed by pill count. Other adherence-related variables, including barriers, self-efficacy, depression, and sociodemographic variables, were collected via a telephone survey. Analysis. Chi-square analysis tested the hypothesis that a greater proportion of participants in the AP intervention are ≥ 80% adherent compared to the control group. General linear modeling examined adherence as a continuous variable. Results. Participants receiving the intervention did not differ from individuals in the control group (51% vs. 49% adherent, respectively; p = .67). Clinic type predicted adherence (p < .0001), as did forgetting to take medications (p = .01) and difficulty getting to the clinic to obtain medications (p < .001). Conclusions. Multilevel interventions that focus on individual behavior and community-level targets (e.g., how health care is accessed and delivered) may be needed to improve medication adherence among low-income rural residents.

AB- Purpose. In New Zealand, the School Travel Plan (STP) program was developed to increase school-related active travel rates and decrease traffic congestion. The plan was developed through collaboration among the school, community, and local council. The STP was tailored to each school's specific needs and incorporated educational initiatives, physical infrastructural changes in the vicinity of schools, and policy development. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the STP program in changing school travel modes in children. Design. Effectiveness was assessed by determining the difference between pre-STP and follow-up travel mode data in schools. The differences were assessed using multilinear regression analysis, including decile (measure of socioeconomic status), school roll at baseline, and STP year of implementation as predictors. Setting. Thirty-three elementary schools from the Auckland region participated in the study. School size ranged from 130 to 688 students. Subjects. The final 2006 sample consisted of 13,631 students. Measures. On a set day (pre- and post-STP), students indicated their mode of transport to school and intended mode for returning home that day. Results. Differences are reported as percentage points: there was an increase in active transport by 5.9% ± 6.8% when compared to baseline travel modes. School roll, STP year of implementation, and baseline values predicted engagement with active transport. Conclusion. Preliminary findings suggest that the STP program may be successful in creating mode shift changes to favor school-related active travel in elementary-school children. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine the effectiveness of a 3-month home-based booster program for seniors to increase walking. Design. A longitudinal prospective study. Setting. Perth, Western Australia. Subjects. Of the 177 (of 260) program participants and 236 (of 313) controls who initially completed the neighborhood walking intervention, 114 (64%) and 134 (57%) were available for the booster, and 100 and 131 participants completed the entire program, respectively. Intervention. A 6-month neighborhood walking intervention was followed 12 months later by a 3- month home-based booster program comprised of print-based materials, a pedometer, and two motivational phone calls. Measures. A self-reported questionnaire was administered at four time points, original intervention, baseline (t1) and 6 months (t2); booster, 18 months (t3) and 21 months (t4);. Physical activity levels were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Personal and demographic information was collected. Analysis. Descriptive statistics and repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results. The intervention group's mean time spent walking for recreation and mean time spent walking for errands per week showed significant increases between t1 and t2, but the weekly mean time walking for recreation dropped by 52 minutes from t2 to t3. Significant increases were evident from t3 to t4 as a result of the booster. Walking levels for the control group remained stable over the study period. Conclusion. Physical activity levels of seniors revert once an intervention concludes A home-based booster program can reactivate physical activity levels. Hence, program planners should include booster sessions for program sustainability. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Social support may help smokers quit and buffer against factors that hinder quitting. The study's aims are to examine which types of social support are effective for quitting smoking among Latino smokers and whether social support buffers the effects of depressed mood on smoking cessation. Design, Setting, Subjects. Participants were Latino smokers with children with asthma (N = 131, mean age = 37 years, 73% female). They did not have to want to quit smoking to participate. Smoking status was biochemically verified at a 3-month follow-up. Measures. Social support was assessed as whether or not the participant had a significant other, level of perceived general support (Interpersonal Support Evaluation List) and level of perceived partner support for smoking cessation (Partner Interaction Questionnaire). Depressed mood was assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale. Analysis. Hierarchical logistic regression. Results. Thirty percent of those with a partner quit smoking versus 14.3% of those without a partner. 43.5% of those with high levels of perceived positive partner support quit smoking vs. 17.4% of those with low levels. There was a significant interaction between whether or not a smoker had a partner and depressed mood on quitting: among those not partnered, quit rates were higher among those with low levels of depressed mood (37%) than among those with high levels of depressed mood (9%; odds ratio 1.147, 95% confidence interval = 1.031-1.276, p <.02). Among those partnered, quit rates were not significantly different between those with high vs. low levels of depressed mood. Conclusions. This paper is the first to examine multiple sources of support for smoking cessation in Latino smokers; partner support and the presence of a significant other are associated with quitting smoking.

AB- Purpose. No studies have examined the differences in smoking attitudes and behavior between Dominicans (DRs) and Puerto Ricans (PRs). Identification of pretreatment differences is important far cultural adaptation of evidenced-based smoking cessation treatments. Design. Secondary analysis. Setting/Intervention. Three home visits for asthma education and smoking cessation. Subjects. Caregivers who smoke and have a child with asthma: DRs (n = 30), PRs (n = 67), and non-Latino whites (n = 128; NLWs). Measures. Baseline assessment of psychosocial variables. Analyses. Controlled for age, education, and acculturation. Results. Compared with DRs, PRs were more acculturated, more nicotine dependent, less motivated and confident to quit, and identified more pros of smoking (all p <.05). Compared with NLWs, PRs were less likely to be employed, smoked fewer cigarettes per day, and had lower education, greater depressed mood, greater pros and cons of smoking, less social support, and higher child asthma morbidity (all p <.05). Compared with NLWs, DRs were less nicotine dependent, more confident to quit, and less likely to live with a smoker, reported greater cons of smoking and greater stress; and were more likely to have a household smoking ban (DRs 60% vs. NLWs 33.6 %). Only 3.3% of DRs were precontemplators vs. 16.4% (PRs) and 10.9% (NLWs). Conclusions. PRs appear to have more factors associated with risk of smoking treatment failure; DRs appear to have more protective factors. Examination of the role of these smoking attitudes as potential moderators and mediators of smoking behavior are needed to guide the cultural adaptation of evidenced-based treatments.

AB- Purpose. Despite a high prevalence of voluntary home smoking bans and laws protecting Californians from exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) in the workplace, many Hispanic/Latino (H/L) residents of multiunit housing (MUH) are potentially exposed to SHS from neighboring apartments. An advocacy/policy intervention was implemented to reduce tobacco-related health disparities by encouraging H/L living in MUH to implement voluntary policies that reduce exposure to SHS. This article presents findings from qualitative and quantitative data collected during development of the intervention, as well as preliminary results of the intervention. Design, Setting, and Subjects. MUH residents in Southern California participated in focus groups (n = 48), door-to-door surveys (n = 142), and a telephone survey (n = 409). Measures. Exposure to SHS, attitudes toward SHS, and attitudes toward policies restricting SHS in MUH were assessed. Results. H/L MUH residents reported high levels of exposure to SHS and little ability to protect themselves and their families from SHS. Respondents expressed positive attitudes toward adapting antismoking policies in MUH, but they a/so feared retaliation by smokers. The cultural values of familismo, respeto, simpatía, and personalismo influenced their motivation to protect their families from SHS as well as their reluctance to ask their neighbors to refrain from smoking. Nonsmokers were more likely to favor complete indoor and outdoor smoking bans in MUH, whereas smokers were more likely to favor separate smoking areas. The Regale Salud advocacy/policy intervention, implemented to reduce SHS exposure, prompted the passage of seven voluntary policies in apartment complexes in Southern California to prevent smoking in MUH. Conclusions. H/L in California support voluntary policies, local ordinances, and state laws that prevent exposure to SHS in MUH, especially those that are consistent with H/L cultural values and norms for interpersonal communication.

AB- Purpose. Prenatal smoking is a preventable risk factor for poor perinatal outcomes and is more prevalent in pregnant smokers of low socioeconomic status (SES). We describe the intervention model and factors associated with quitting from the Pittsburgh STOP Program, an evidence-informed dissemination intervention for low-SES pregnant smokers. Setting. STOP is delivered in community health care clinics serving economically disadvantaged women. Participants. Participants were 856 pregnant women who were current smokers (93%) and recent quitters (7%). Most were white (59%) or black (35%), single (74%), young (mean age = 25), and experiencing an unplanned pregnancy (84%); 90% were insured by Medicaid/uninsured. Methods. An evidence-informed intervention for community pregnant women was delivered individually in a single-group pre-post evaluation design. Measures were demographics, participation and retention, smoking status, satisfaction, and cost. Analyses included descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Results. Participants attended an average of 4.7 sessions. Dropout rate after the first session was 5%. Over 11% of smokers quit; 48% of preenrollment spontaneous quitters remained abstinent. Factors significantly associated with quitting included race, mother's age, nicotine dependence, and number of sessions attended. Limitations. STOP is a community program with self-selected participants and no control group. Conclusion. Low-income pregnant smokers will engage in an evidence-informed cessation program tailored for this group, with quit rates that compare to controlled research results. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine proportions of provider advice to quit smoking for Asian-American smokers and to describe factors that may affect the provision of such advice. Design. Secondary data analysis of population-based survey. Setting. California. Subjects. Current smokers from the California Tobacco Use Surveys for Chinese-Americans (n = 2117, participation rate = 52%), Korean-Americans (n = 2545, participation rate = 48%), and Vietnamese-Americans (n = 2179, participation rate = 63.5%) Measures. Sociodemographics including insurance status, smoking frequency, provider visit in past year, and provider advice to quit. Analysis. Multivariate logistic regression models examined dependent outcomes of (1) provider visit in past year and (2) provider advice to quit. Results. Less than a third (30.5%) of smokers in our study reported both seeing a provider (50.8%) and then receiving advice to quit (60.1%). Factors associated with provider visits included being female, being 45 years or older, having health insurance, and being Vietnamese. Among smokers who saw a provider, factors associated with provider advice to quit included having health insurance and being a daily smoker. Conclusions. Asian-American smokers reported low proportions of provider advice to quit in the past year, largely because only half of smokers saw a provider. Providers who see such smokers may need greater awareness that several effective cessation treatments do not require health insurance, and that intermittent smokers need advice to quit.

AB- Purpose. Evaluate a tailored approach for tobacco dependence treatment for American Indians. Design. A single-group design evaluation of a culturally specific curriculum for tobacco dependence treatment was implemented. Baseline assessment, program utilization, and 90-day follow-up interview data were analyzed. Setting. Fond du Lac Reservation in rural Minnesota and Mashkiki Waakaaigan Pharmacy in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Subjects. American Indian adults (N = 317). Intervention. Four 1-hour individual or group sessions of behavioral counseling paired with pharmacotherapy. Measures. Demographic variables, program satisfaction, and tobacco use behaviors. Analysis. Descriptive statistics; for abstinence, a smoking = missing analysis was used, assuming all nonrespondents were still smoking. Results. Sixty-three percent of participants completed the program. The 90-day follow-up response rate was 47%. Of those who completed, 47% reported abstinence at the 90-day follow-up. Missing = smoking analysis yielded a 21.8% quit rate. Continuing smokers cut their daily smoking by half from 17 to eight cigarettes, 88% reported an increase in self-efficacy for their next quit, and 44% planned to quit within 30 days. Conclusion. Evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment programs tailored to be culturally specific have the potential to significantly affect the burden of tobacco-related disparities among American Indians.

AB- Purpose. Little is known about population-level rates and reasons for low intentions to call the quitline, a widely available evidence-based smoking cessation treatment. Design. This study is a secondary analysis of the 2008 Colorado Adult Tobacco Attitudes and Behavior Survey. Setting. This is a population-based telephone survey of adults in Colorado. Subjects. Study respondents (N = 1662) included current adult smokers who had heard of the Colorado QuitLine (QL) and did not report that they never intend to quit. Measures. Outcome measures included intent to call the QL, self-reported reasons for not intending to call the QL, and knowledge of QL services. Analysis. Descriptive and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used for each outcome variable. All analyses were weighted for complex survey design to represent the population of Colorado. Results. Overall 45.6% of smokers intend never to call the QL. In multivariate analysis, Latinos (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.4, 4.7), gay/lesbian/bisexuals (OR = 5.2; 95% CI, 2.4, 11.4), and those with no insurance compared with Medicaid (OR = 3.8, 95% CI, 1.1, 13.0) were most likely to intend never to call the QL. Perceiving no need for assistance (34.8%) was the most common reason for not calling. Conclusions. A majority of smokers have no or weak intentions of ever calling the QL, with variation by subgroup. Reasons for not intending to call can inform targeted media campaigns to increase QL reach. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To compare the utilization rate of a statewide tobacco quitline by African-American smokers to that of white smokers. Design, Setting, and Subjects. Observational study of 18 years of state quitline operation in California. Subjects were 61,096 African-American and 279,042 while smokers who called the quitline from August 1992 to December 2009. Data from six California Tobacco Surveys, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008 were also used. Measure. Callers' answers to the question how they heard about the quitline were grouped into four categories: media, health care providers, friends/family, and others. Analysis. The averaged annual quitline call volume for each ethnic group was divided by the total number of smokers in that group, based on California Tobacco Surveys, to produce the annual quitline utilization rate. Results. In five out of six periods of comparison, African-American smokers had a higher annual utilization rate than white smokers. The odds ratios [ORs] ranged from 1.44 to 2.40 (all p < .05). In the 1996 comparison, the OR was .90 (p < .05). The difference in utilization rates that is attributed to media, accounts far most of the difference in total utilization rates between the two ethnic groups. Conclusions. Within the context of California's comprehensive tobacco control program, which includes a strong media campaign, African-American smokers were significantly more likely to call the slate quitline than white smokers were. Promoting the quitline as part of antismoking media campaigns can help reduce disparity in cessation service utilization. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To assess the effectiveness of a large-scale, national smoking cessation media campaign, the EX campaign, across racial/ethnic and educational subgroups. Design. A longitudinal random-digit-dial panel study conducted prior to and 6 months following the national launch of the campaign. Setting. The sample was drawn from eight designated media markets in the United States. Subjects. The baseline survey was conducted on 5616 current smokers, aged 18 to 49 years, and 4067 (73% follow-up response rate) were resurveyed at the 6-month follow-up. Measures. The primary independent variable is confirmed awareness of the campaign advertising, and the outcome variables are follow-up cessation-related cognitions index score and quit attempts. Analysis. Multivariable logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted within racial/ethnic and educational strata to assess the strength of association between confirmed awareness of campaign advertising and cessation-related outcomes. Results. Confirmed awareness of campaign advertising increased favorable cessation-related cognitions among Hispanics and quit attempts among non-Hispanic blacks, and increased favorable cessation-related cognitions and quit attempts among smokers with less than a high school education. Conclusions. These results suggest that the EX campaign may be effective in promoting cessation-related cognitions and behaviors among minority and disadvantaged smokers who experience a disproportionate burden of tobacco-related illness and mortality.

AB- Purpose. Youth and young adults with mental health disorders and addictions are at a high risk of becoming nicotine dependent, and at least half will die of tobacco-related diseases. In comparison to the general population, this population also faces neurobiological and psychosocial vulnerabilities. There is a critical need for community services and research targeting tobacco interventions for these individuals. Methods. A concurrent mixed methods study was conducted by collecting data from in-depth key informant interviews, focus groups, and a survey. Qualitative key informant interviews with healthcare professionals (n = 11) and youth focus groups (n = 32) were conducted by using semi-structured questioning regarding barriers and facilitators to tobacco interventions. Content analysis was used to code transcripts and categorize themes. Survey data were also collected from 230 smokers ages 13 to 17 years (n = 62) and young adults ages 18 to 25 years (n = 40) at three community mental health centers. The survey inquired about tobacco use, motivation to quit, history of quit attempts, and treatment preferences. Results. Five thematic categories were identified in both the adult key informant interviews and the focus groups with youth: (1) motivation to quit, (2) cessation treatment needs, (3) social influence, (4) barriers to treatment, and (5) tobacco-free policy. Among those surveyed, 44% currently smoked. Youth and young adult survey respondents who smoked were often motivated to quit, few had used proven tobacco cessation aids, but there was interest in access to nicotine replacement therapy. Conclusion. Merged qualitative and quantitative findings support past literature regarding youth in the general population but also expand upon our knowledge of issues specific to youth and young adults with mental health disorders and addictions. Findings suggest interventions warranting further attention in community treatment settings. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Background. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United Stales. Among racial and ethnic minorities, disparities in tobacco use, knowledge of health risks and treatment resources, and access to and utilization of treatment contribute to a disproportionate disease burden from tobacco use. Furthermore, racial and ethnic minorities have been underrepresented within tobacco treatment studies. Purpose/Objective. This paper provides a review of published studies examining tobacco treatment interventions among ethnic and minority populations in the United States. Study Design/Methods. Literature searches were used to identify smoking cessation interventions involving racial/ethnic minority populations. Identified studies were published between 1985 and 2009 involving African-American, Latino, Native American, and Asian or Pacific Islander smokers. Studies included in the review (1) targeted one or more ethnic minority group or had at least 10% of study participants from ethnic minority groups and (2) reported abstinence outcomes. Results. Sixty-four studies were included in this review. Of studies meeting inclusion criteria, 28 included a primary focus on African-Americans, 10 focused on Latinos, 4 focused on Native Americans, and 3 focused on Asian-American smokers. An additional 19 studies reported samples including participants from more than one minority group. Sample inclusion criteria, intervention content and duration, follow-up, abstinence assessment, and limitations of these studies were reviewed. Conclusions. Individuals from racial and ethnic minority populations are interested in stopping smoking and willing to participate in treatment research. Variations in the content of treatment intervention and study design produced a range of abstinence out comes across studies. Additional research is needed for all groups, including African-American smokers, and special attention is warranted for Latino, Native American, and Asian groups given the paucity of published studies. Although there were limited evaluations of pharmacotherapy, the existing data support use of pharmacotherapy in addition to counseling for enhancing abstinence outcomes. Further attention to level of individual smoking, variability in smoking patterns, and use of other tobacco products is needed, given known variation within and between racial and ethnic groups. Overall, findings are consistent with recommendations from the 2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines calling for increased research devoted to evaluating and enhancing tobacco use treatment interventions among racial and ethnic minority populations.

The relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity in tobacco-related disparities is also discussed.

AB- Purpose. Evidence on environmental correlates of physical activity (PA) conducted in Western developed countries may not be generalizable to Africa. This study examined the associations between perception of the neighborhood environment and PA and walking in African young adults. Design. Cross-sectional analysis of self-reported survey. Setting. University of Ibadan, in the capital city of Oyo State, Nigeria. Subjects. A representative sample of undergraduates of a Nigerian university, age 16 to 39 years and 50.7% female. Measures. Total walking activity and PA were measured with the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Sixteen perceived neighborhood environmental variables were measured using the Physical Activity Neighborhood Environment Scale (PANES), which was used to assess environmental correlates of PA that are internationally relevant. Outcomes were meeting health-related guidelines for sufficient PA and walking activity. Results. After adjustments for demographics and dormitory site, the proximity of bus/transit stop (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41), traffic as not a problem (OR = .45; unexpected direction), and not many four-way intersections (OR = .72; unexpected direction) were significantly associated with sufficient PA. Low crime rate at night (OR = 1.53), many interesting things to look at (OR = 1.90), and seeing many people active (OR = .59; unexpected direction) were significantly associated with sufficient walking. Inconsistent patterns were also observed in gender-specific analyses. Conclusion. Few neighborhood environment correlates of PA or walking reported in the international literature were replicated with African young adults. Environmental measures need to be developed that are tailored to low- and middle-income countries, such as those in Africa, so that research in understudied regions can advance. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- In this article the author discusses the role of the stakeholder in health promotion programming in the workplace. The author suggests that a large number of internal and external stakeholders, such as employees and vendors, respectively, are directly affected by worksite health promotion (WHP) or wellness programs. He notes that the size of the company is related to the number of individual stakeholders and stakeholder groups to be considered when establishing a WHP program. Topics include an overview of the group of people comprising internal and external stakeholders, stakeholders' initial reaction to a WHP program, and what organization should ideally want from stakeholders.

AB- Purpose. Using the Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT), the effect of mode of administration on (1) students' willingness to disclose sensitive information and (2) response rates was investigated. Design. A 2 × 2 unequal N factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) design was employed. Mode of administration (paper-and-pencil vs. Web-based) was crossed with grade level (middle vs. high school). Setting. The study was conducted in two middle and two high schools. Subjects. A total of 628 middle and high school students completed the survey. Measures. The POSIT is a self-report measure with 139 yes/no items that identifies stressors in 10 functional areas (e.g., Substance Use). Analysis. An unequal N 2 (mode) × 2 (grade level) factorial ANOVA was employed. Results. No statistically significant differences were found for self-reported risk across modes of administration. Students completing the Web-based version of the survey were four times more likely to skip an item. Conclusions. Effect of Mode on Reporting of Sensitive Information—Students computed the Web-based surveys in computer labs with other students. The intent of the Web-based survey was to increase perceived privacy but the environment likely negated any effect. Effect of Mode on Response Rates—The higher response rate for the paper-and-pencil survey was the opposite of what was expected and revealed that students were more likely to ship sensitive items on the Web survey.

AB- Purpose. A retrospective, longitudinal study examined changes in participation in fitness-related activities and hospital claims over 5 years amongst members of an incentivized health promotion program offered by a private health insurer. Design. A 3-year retrospective observational analysis measuring gym visits and participation in documented fitness-related activities, probability of hospital admission, and associated costs of admission. Setting. A South African private health plan, Discovery Health and the Vitality health promotion program. Participants. 304,054 adult members of the Discovery medical plan, 192,467 of whom registered for the health promotion program and 111,587 members who were not on the program. Intervention. Members were incentivised for fitness-related activities on the basis of the frequency of gym visits. Measures. Changes in electronically documented gym visits and registered participation in fitness-related activities over 3 years and measures of association between changes in participation (years 1-3) and subsequent probability and costs of hospital admission (years 4-5). Hospital admissions and associated costs are hosed on claims extracted from the health insurer database. Analysis. The probability of a claim modeled by using linear logistic regression and costs of claims examined by using general linear models. Propensity scores were estimated and included age, gender, registration for chronic disease benefits, plan type, and. the presence of a claim during the transition period, and these were used as covariates in the final model. Results. There was a significant decrease in the prevalence of inactive members (76% to 68%) over 5 years. Members who remained highly active (years 1-3) had a lower probability (p <. 05) of hospital admission in years 4 to 5 (20. 7%) compared with those who remained inactive (22.2%). The odds of admission were 13% lower for two additional gym visits per week (odds ratio, .87; 95% confidence interval [CI], .801-. 949). Conclusion. We observed an increase in fitness-related activities over time amongst members of this incentive-based health promotion program, which was associated with a lower probability of hospital admission and lower hospital costs in the subsequent 2 years.

AB- Purpose: To determine the effects of an environmental intervention on obesity, disease risk factors, and dietary intake in an employee population. Design: Randomized controlled community trial. Setting: Eight manufacturing companies in Kentucky with ∼ 150 to 350 employees each. Subjects: Randomly selected employees. Intervention: Multicomponent environmental intervention that included employee advisory committees, point-of-decision prompts, walking paths, cafeteria/vending changes, and educational materials. Measures: Height; weight; body fat; blood pressure; fasting lipids, glucose and insulin; and dietary intake were assessed prior to and 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of the intervention. Analysis: Mixed-model repeat-measure analyses of covariance were used to analyze data collected over the study period. Categorical data were analyzed in contingency tables. A p value of. 05 was used to judge statistical significance. Results: There were no intervention effects for outcome variables, with the exception of lower intake of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol in the intervention group compared to the control group. Over the course of the study, changes in anthropometry and biomeasures were similar in both groups. Conclusions: Findings indicate that subtle environmental changes alone may not impact employees' weight and health; however, such institutional-level approaches may be essential to support healthy lifestyle habits that are initiated by more intensive efforts. Academic researchers should continue to partner with employers and, practitioners to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative health promotion strategies including environmental interventions.

AB- Purpose. Computer use, Internet access, and online searching for health information were assessed toward enhancing Internet use for health promotion. Design. Cross-sectional random digit dial landline phone survey. Setting. Eight zip codes that comprised Central Harlem/Hamilton Heights and East Harlem in New York City. Subjects. Adults 18 years and older (N = 646). Measures. Demographic characteristics, computer use, Internet access, and, online searching for health information. Analysis. Frequencies for categorical variables and means and standard deviations fin-continuous variables were calculated and compared with analogous findings reported in national surveys from similar time periods. Results. Among Harlem adults, ever computer use and current Internet use were 77% and 52%, respectively. High-speed home Internet connections were somewhat lower for Harlem adults than for U.S. adults overall (43% vs: 68%). Current Internet users in Harlem were more likely to be younger, white vs. black or Hispanic, better educated, and in better self-reported health than non-current users (p < .01). Of those who reported searching online for health information, 74 % sought information on medical problems and thought that information found on the Internet affected the way they eat (4 7 %) or exercise (44%). Conclusions. Many Harlem adults currently use the Internet to search for health information. High-speed connections and culturally relevant materials may facilitate health information searching for underserved groups. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this study was to evaluate two potential methods for increasing participant compliance with behavioral self-monitoring (BSM). Design. A randomized 2 × 2 factorial design was used to evaluate the effects of target behavior choice (choice vs. assigned) and self-management skills training (training vs. no-training) on BSM compliance. In the choice manipulation, participants either chose or were assigned one of seven types of healthful or safe behaviors to self-monitor. In the training manipulation, participants either completed computer-based self-management skills training or received no training. Participants were then asked to complete daily BSM for 2 weeks. Setting. The study was conducted at a university and teaching hospital. Subjects. Participants (N = 60) were predominantly university and hospital employees. Measures. The primary dependent measure was percent compliance with BSM. Analysis. A factorial analysis of variance of compliance scores was performed. Results. Mean compliance with prescribed BSM was 52.6% (SD = 31.8). The main effect for choice was significant, with choice participants showing 18% higher BSM compliance than those in no-choice conditions (d = .59; p < .05). The effects of self-management skills training and the interaction term were both nonsignificant. Conclusion. Although self-management skills training did not appear to affect BSM compliance, offering individuals a choice in target behavior substantially increased both BSM compliance and self-reported behavior change.

AB- Purpose. The main purposes of this study were to assess TV viewing among Hispanic young children and to examine effects of having a TV in the child's bedroom (TVIB). Design and Setting. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate an intervention program that is collecting longitudinal data in West Texas. However, the current report uses only the baseline data of the ongoing study. Subjects. Predominantly low-income and Hispanic parents/guardians (N = 315) and their children of 5 to 9 years (N = 597). Measures. Children's anthropometric measures were obtained. Their overweight status was determined based on age- and gender-adjusted body mass index. A demographic questionnaire, acculturation scale (brief version of Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans II), and family survey were used among parents. Analysis. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, X² tests, and logistic regressions were used. Results. Most children (70%) have TVIB; more than 30% were or were at risk of overweight. Demographic characteristics did not significantly predict TVIB. Children with TVIB spent .93 hours more daily watching TV/DVD (t = 3.07; df = 283; p = .003), and children (at one site) ate more fast food (X² = 5.46; df = 1; p = .019), compared with children without TVIB whose parents better supported physical activity (t = 2.11; df = 275; p = .039). Conclusion. Most children in this low-income and Hispanic sample have TVIB, which is associated with unhealthy behaviors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Evaluate youth assets or potential strengths and sexual intercourse associations by household income. Design. Data consisted of youth and parent responses from randomly selected households from a cross-sectional study and wave one of a longitudinal extension of that study. Youth assets and sexual intercourse were compared for four income categories. Setting. Midwestern racially diverse, inner-city neighborhoods. Subjects. One adolescent (12-19 years) and one parent (2335 pairs). Measures. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression. Variables assessed included parent and youth demographics, youth sexual intercourse, and youth assets (adult and peer role models, family communication, use of time [religion or sports], community involvement, future aspirations, responsible choices, and health practices). Results. Youths' mean age was 14.9 (± 1.8) years, and 52% were female; 44% of respondents were white. Use of time (religion) was significantly associated with never having sex for all but the lowest income youth (OR range = 1. 79-2.64). The variable peer role models was significant for the lowest income (OR = 2.01) and two upper income groups (ORs = 2.52 and 4.27, respectively). The variable future aspirations was significant for the lowest income youth (OR - 1.77). Conclusion. The youth asset variable future aspirations was critical for the lowest income households. Other asset variables, such as peer role models and use of time (religion) were critical regardless of income. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Determine the proportion of adults aware of Canada's Physical Activity Guide to Healthy Active Living (Guide) and its specific recommendations (objective 1); whether key demographic factors (objective 2a) and physical activity behavior (objective 2b) are associated with awareness and specific familiarity with the Guide; and if changes in awareness and specific recommendations with the Guide occurred over a 1-year period (objective 3a and 3b). Design. Random selection with computer-assisted telephone interviewing. Setting. Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Subjects. A total of 2803 adults 18 years or older completed interviews from 4831 telephone contacts (response rate, 58.0%), and after 1 year, 1423 individuals (55%) completed interviews. Measures. Demographic, physical activity, Guide awareness. Analysis. Chi-square, analysis of variance. Results. At baseline, 27.3% were aware of the Guide, and 15.6% were familiar with the Guide's specific recommendations. Younger individuals (p = .01), women (p < .001), and those with a higher education (p < .001) were more likely to be generally aware of the Guide, and women were also more specifically aware (p = .01). Physical activity levels were positively associated with the general (p < .001) and specific (p < .001) awareness of the Guide. Changes in general familiarity and specific recommendations over 1 year were observed. Conclusions. The majority of those surveyed were not familiar with the Guide. Men, individuals with a lower education, and older individuals may need to be specifically targeted. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To evaluate the effects of a multicomponent, family-based, culturally tailored intervention for overweight Latino children and their parents. Design. One group pretest/posttest with clinic comparison group. Setting. Community health center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Subjects. 54 Spanish-speaking, Latino families with children 8 to 11 years of age at enrollment and a body mass index (BMI) >85th percentile. Thirty-one completed the 12-month follow-up. Main Outcome Measures. BMI, fitness measures, self-reported eating patterns, sedentary behaviors, and quality of life scales. Intervention. Index child and one (index) parent participated in interactive sessions and physical activity reinforced by family goal-setting, staff support, and supplemental activities. Results. Small but statistically significant changes in child BMI z score (△ = -13 SD, p < .001) and parent fitness (△ = .74, p <04) were documented by paired t-test. Quality of life increased significantly for children (combined Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory score △ = 10.7, p < .001) and parents (Short Form Health Survey12 mental composite score △ = 8, p < .022; Wilcoxon rank sum test). BMI z score for clinic comparison children (n = 31) increased significantly during the same time period (△ = .23 SD, paired t = 4.32, p < .0002). Conclusions. A culturally tailored program for Latino families reduced BMI for enrolled children and significantly enhanced quality of life for children and parents. Intervention approaches that integrate cultural and social circumstances and emphasize goal setting and life style changes may be fruitful for this population of at-risk children.

AB- Purpose. Explore the role of the neighborhood environment in supporting walking. Design. Cross-sectional study of 10,286 residents of 200 neighborhoods. Participants were selected using a stratified two-stage cluster design. Data were collected by mail survey (68.5% response rate). Setting. Brisbane City Local Government Area, Australia, 2007. Subjects. Brisbane residents aged 40 to 65 years. Measures. Environmental: street connectivity, residential density, hilliness, tree coverage, bikeways, and streetlights within a 1-km circular buffer from each resident's home; and network distance to nearest river or coast, public transport, shop, and park. Walking: minutes walked in the previous week: <30 minutes, ≥30 to <90 minutes, ≥90 to <150 minutes, ≥150 to <300 minutes, and ≥300 minutes. Analysis. The association between each neighborhood characteristic and walking was examined using multilevel multinomial logistic regression, and the model parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Results. After adjustment for individual factors, the likelihood of walking for more than 300 minutes (relative to ,30 minutes) was highest in areas with the most connectivity (odds ratio [OR] 5 1.93; 99% confidence intervals [CI], 1.32-2.80), greatest residential density (OR 5 1.47; 99% CI, 1.02-2.12), least tree coverage (OR 5 1.69; 99% CI, 1.13-2.51), most bikeways (OR 5 1.60; 99% CI, 1.16-2.21), and most streetlights (OR 5 1.50; 99% CI, 1.07-2.11). The likelihood of walking for more than 300 minutes was also higher among those who lived closest to a river or the coast (OR 5 2.06; 99% CI, 1.41-3.02). Conclusion. The likelihood of meeting (and exceeding) physical activity recommendations on the basis of walking was higher in neighborhoods with greater street connectivity and residential density, more streetlights and bikeways, closer proximity to waterways, and less tree coverage. Interventions targeting these neighborhood characteristics may lead to improved environmental quality as well as lower rates of overweight and obesity and associated chromic disease.

A large number of U.S. citizens are affiliated with some type of religious worship, with a majority claiming an affiliation with the Christian faith through either Protestant or Catholic worship. The authors therefore examine the potential for institutions such as churches to endorse exercise, health screenings, and motivational interventions. Health care reform laws and health care costs are also discussed.

AB- Purpose. Assess whether an insurer-provided Web-based wellness program results in cost and utilization improvements. Design. Quasi-experimental, pre-post, treatment-comparison design. Variables of interest were participation rates; medical, professional, and pharmacy expenditures; inpatient admissions; emergency room visits; and preventive service utilization. Setting. Six hundred forty-three employer-based wellness programs in Pennsylvania. Subjects. Forty-seven employers engaged in the Web-based wellness program and 596 employers who were not engaged. The engaged employer group included 10,463 wellness participants; an equal number of matched nonparticipant employees were identified from employers who were not engaged. Intervention. Web-based wellness program features were added to an on-site program in 2004. The program was followed through 2007. Measures. Outcomes were calculated, using health insurance enrollment and claims history. Analysis. Participating employees were compared to nonparticipants using generalized linear mixed models to study changes in costs and utilization. Results. During the 2003 baseline year, engaged employers had greater costs, greater chronic disease prevalence, and greater hospitalization. Costs of program participants showed a lower rate of increase in 2004, and then dropped below those of the nonparticipants for the duration of the study. Between 2003 and 2007, the increase in medical expenditures of the participant group was significantly less than that of the nonparticipant group (31 % vs. 46%, p < .01). In addition, the participant group showed a lower increase in professional service expenditures (p = .02) and greater utilization of preventive services (p < .01). Conclusions. Web-based insurer-provided wellness programs may decrease health care costs and encourage preventive service utilization. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine associations between worksite physical activity promotion strategies and employees' physical activity and sedentary behaviors. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. Seattle—King County, Washington and Baltimore, Maryland—Washington, D. C. regions. Subjects. Adults working outside the home (n = 1313). Mean age was 45 ± 10 years, 75.8% of participants were non-Hispanic white, 56% were male, and 51% had income ≥$70,000/year. Measures. Participants reported demographic characteristics and presence/absence of nine physical activity promotion environment and policy strategies in their work environment (e.g., showers, lockers, physical activity programs). A worksite physical activity promotion index was a tally of strategies. Total sedentary and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) min/d were objectively assessed via 7-day accelerometry. Total job-related physical activity minutes and recreational physical activity minutes were self-reported with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Analysis. Mixed-effects models and generalized estimating equations evaluated the association of the worksite promotion index with physical activity and sedentary behavior, adjusting for demographics. Results. A higher worksite promotion index was significantly associated with higher total sedentary behavior(β = 3.97), MVPA (β = 1.04), recreational physical activity (β = 1.1 and odds ratio = 1.39; away from work and at work, respectively) and negatively with job-related physical activity (β = .90). Conclusions. Multiple worksite physical activity promotion strategies based on environmental supports and policies may increase recreational physical activity and should be evaluated in controlled trials. These findings are particularly important given the increasingly sedentary nature of employment. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine associations of intervention dose with behavior change outcomes in a telephone counseling intervention for physical activity and dietary change. Design. Secondary analysis of intervention participants from a cluster-randomized controlled trial. Setting. Primary care practices in a disadvantaged community in Queensland, Australia. Subjects. Adult patients with type 2 diabetes or hypertension. Intervention. Patients (n = 228) received telephone counseling over a 12-month period. The initiation phase (1-4 months) consisted of up to 10 weekly or fortnightly calls; the maintenance-enhancement phase (5-12 months) consisted of up to eight monthly calls. Measures. Intervention dose was defined as the number of calls completed in total and during each phase and was categorized into tertiles. Diet and physical activity were measured using validated self-report instruments. Analysis. Multivariate analyses of call completion and change in health behaviors. Results. Those completing a high number of calls were more likely to be female, white, older than 60 years, retired, and earning less than an average weekly Australian wage. Relative to low call completion, high completion during the maintenance-enhancement phase was associated with significantly greater (least squares mean (SEJ) behavioral improvement for the following: total fat intake as percentage of calories (-3.58% [.74%]), saturated fat intake (-2.51 % [.51%]), fiber intake (4.23 [1.20] g), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (187.82 [44.78] minutes). Conclusion. Interventions of longer duration may be required to influence complex behaviors such as physical activity and fat and fiber intake. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Environmental conditions often serve as critical enabling factors for health promotion. This article describes the effect of a preschool hygiene intervention program on classroom environmental conditions. Design. Cluster randomized trial, with randomization at the level of the preschool. Setting. State-run preschools in Jerusalem. Subjects. Forty secular and religious Jerusalem preschools (including 1029 children). Intervention. A multidisciplinary hygiene intervention that included changes to the preschool environment. Measures. Presence of soap, soap dispenser, paper towel, paper towel dispenser, cloth towels, communal cup, or personal cups. Analysis. Generalized estimating equations and Fisher's exact test were used to estimate the effect of the intervention program on environmental conditions. Results. Information was obtained from most (97.9%) visits. Baseline environmental hygienic conditions were poor. Relative to the control group, the following environmental conditions were better in the intervention group after program implementation: soap (odds ratio [OR] = 14.7; p < .01), paper towels (OR = 13.5; p < .01), communal cups (OR = .05; p < .01), soap dispensers (secular preschools only, p < .01), individual cups (secular, p < .01; religious, OR = 18.7;p < .02). Conclusions. Environmental hygiene in the Israeli preschools studied was deficient at baseline but amenable to change. Improvement in environmental conditions was a necessary enabling factor for the changes in hand-washing behavior that were observed among the children. Sustained environmental change is possible in the preschool environment. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study investigated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and risk behaviors in a longitudinal sample of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Design. Data came from the Healthy Young Men's study, comprising five waves of nonexperimental survey data collection every 6 months between February 2005 and January 2008. Setting. Participants were recruited from public venues in Los Angeles County in which YMSM spend time. Subjects. A total of 526 participants (24% African-American, 37% white, 39% Latino; mean age, 20.14 years; range, 18-24 years) were enrolled. Retention was 93%. Measures. Testing recency was assessed with a four-point ordinal scale. HIV risk behaviors were operationalized as binary measures of unprotected anal intercourse with multiple partners or partners with unknown or discordant serostatus, club drug use, and illicit drug use over the prior 3 months. Analysis. Correlations, Cochran's Q tests, and repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed in SPSS. Analyses included all data available at each wave. Results. No significant correlations emerged between testing recency and sex risk at any wave. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed significant positive, linear change in HTV testing recency over time, but no significant changes emerged for sex risk or drug use. Conclusion. Although participation in testing increased, there was no corresponding change in HTV risk behavior. Initiatives may need to target risk behavior separately and specifically to reduce these behaviors among YMSM. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Determine the effects of 16 weeks of strength training on measures of functional ability in elderly who are functionally limited. Design. Quasi-experimental trial in which elderly volunteers were assigned to either an exercise group or a control group. Participants. Eighty-seven participants (65-93 years) living independently but with some functional limitations. Intervention. Thirteen different strength training exercises using Thera-Band resistive bands (Hygenic Corporation, Akron, Ohio). The program was 16 weeks in duration, and the frequency was three times per week. Participants exercised in a group setting one time per week and were given a home exercise book to follow for two additional sessions per week. Measures. Functional ability was operationalized to include a variety of measures related to functional ability that impact activities of daily living, morbidity, and mortality in the elderly, including upper- and lower-body strength and gait. Analysis. Intervention effects were analyzed using a 2 (groups: exercise group vs. control group) × 3 (time: baseline vs. mid vs. post) analysis of variance. Results. The exercise group demonstrated significant improvements in upper-body strength as measured by biceps curl (F[2,140] = 39.870; p < .05) and lower-body strength as measured by chair sit-to-stand (F[2,124] = 25.887; p < .05). Gait velocity (F[2,140] = 37.317; p < .05) and step length (F[2,140] = 4.182;p < .05) both increased for the exercise group at week 9, but this increase disappeared by week 17. Compared with minimal changes in the control group, the exercise group demonstrated significant improvements in upper-body strength as measured by biceps curl and lower-body strength as measured by chair sit-to-stand. Conclusion. Some measures of function ability were improved after a 16-week structured exercise program for functionally limited elderly. Because functional ability has been inversely correlated with short-term morbidity and the need for assisted living among older adults, providing opportunities to exercise is crucial to future functioning and independence of the elderly population.

AB- Purpose. The current study compared two interventions for promotion of stair climbing in the workplace, an information-based intervention at a health information day and an environmental intervention (point-of-choice prompts), for their effectiveness in changing stair climbing and cost per employee. Design, Interrupted time-series design. Setting. Four buildings on a university campus. Subjects. Employees at a university in the United Kingdom. Interventions. Two stair-climbing interventions were compared: (1) a stand providing information on stair climbing at a health-information day and, (2) point-of-choice prompts (posters). Measures. Observers recorded employees' gender and method of ascent (n = 4279). The cost of the two interventions was calculated. Analysis. Logistic regression. Results. There was no significant difference between baseline (47.9% stair climbing) and the Workplace Well-being Day (48.8% stair climbing), whereas the prompts increased stair climbing (52.6% stair climbing). 'The health information day and point-of-choice prompts cost $773.96 and $31.38, respectively. Conclusion. The stand, at the health information day was more expensive than the point-of-choice prompts and was inferior in promoting stair climbing. It is likely that the stand was unable to encourage stair climbing because only 3.2% of targeted employees visited the stand. In contrast, the point-of-choice prompts were potentially visible lo all employees using the buildings and hence better for disseminating the stair climbing message to the target audience.

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this pilot study was to conduct an impact evaluation of a 10-week Web-based physical activity intervention. Design. Quasi-experimental, three-group pretest, postlest design. Setting. Large Midwestern university. Subjects. Participants (N = 233) included college students registered for three courses. The study employed a convenience sample consisting of a Web-based group (n = 108), a physical activity group (n = 64), and a general health group (n = 61). Intervention. The Web-based group received a Social Cognitive Theory behavioral skill-building intervention and, exercised 3 days per week in their leisure time. The physical activity group received exercise instruction and was required to attend three physical activity labs per week. The comparison group received health instruction. Measures. Outcome variables included moderate and vigorous physical activity, self-regulation, social support, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations and expectancies. Analysis. Differences between groups were assessed at pretest and posttest using multiple analyses of variance. Results. Vigorous physical activity, self-regulation, and outcome expectancy value changed significantly in the Web-based and physical activity course groups (p < .01). Conclusions. Even with consideration of limitations such as small sample size and lack of randomization, the Web-based and traditional physical activity lecture and activity lab interventions were superior in eliciting changes in vigorous physical activity, self-regulation, and outcome expectancy value than a traditional health course.

The following electronic databases were searched from January 1, 1966, through December 31, 2005: CARL Uncover (via Ingenta), CDP, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Library, CRISP, Dissertation Abstracts, EMBASE, ERIC, Health Canada, INFORM (part of ABI/INFORM Proquest), LocatorPlus, New York Academy of Medicine, Ovid MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, PapersFirst, PsycINFO, PubMed, and TRIP. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Included studies were published in English, conducted at a worksite, designed for adults (aged ≥18 years), and reported weight-related outcomes. Data Extraction. Data were extracted using an online abstraction form. Data Synthesis. Studies were evaluated on the basis of study design suitability quality of execution, sample size, and effect size. Changes in weight-related outcomes were used to assess effectiveness. Results. The following six promising practices were identified: enhanced access to opportunities for physical activity combined with health education, exercise prescriptions alone, multicomponent educational practices, weight loss competitions and incentives, behavioral practices with incentives, and behavioral practices without incentives. Conclusions. These practices will help employers and employees select programs that show promise for controlling and preventing obesity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Test the feasibility and impact of an automated workplace mental health assessment and intervention. Design. Efficacy was evaluated in a randomized control trial comparing employees who received screening and intervention with those who received only screening. Setting. Workplace. Subjects. 463 volunteers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and EMC and oilier employed adults, among whom 164 were randomized to the intervention (N = 87) and control (N = 77) groups. Intervention. The system administers a panel of telephonic assessment instruments followed by tailored information, education, and. referrals. Measures. The Work Limitation Questionnaire, the Medical Outcomes Questionnaire Short Form-12, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, question 10 from the Patient Health Questionnaire to measure functional impairment, and the Perceived Stress Scale-4 and questions written, by study psychiatrists to measure emotional distress and social support respectively. The WHO-Five Well-being Index was administered to measure overall well-bang. Analysis. Independent sample t-tests and χ² tests as well as mean change were used, to compare the data. Results. No significant differences on 16 of the 20 comparisons at 3- and 6-month time, points. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in depression (p ≤ . 05) at 3 months and on two Work Limitation Questionnaire subscales, the, Mental-Interpersonal Scale (p ≤ . 05) and the Time and Scheduling Scale (p ≤ . 05), at 3 and 6 months respectively with a suggestive improvement in mental health at 6 months (p ≤ .10). Conclusions. This is a potentially fruitful area for research with important implications for workplace behavioral interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Develop and test a Web site to encourage physical activity (PA) by sedentary workers. Design. Randomized control design with 30-day follow-up. Setting. Large manufacturing plant. Subjects. Included 221 workers; average body mass index was 29.5. Intervention. Gel Moving was a repeat-visit Web site providing information and. support, to develop a personalized PA plan. Measures. Self-reported: PA, depression, anxiety, stage of change, attitudes, knowledge, self-efficacy, intention, perceived barriers lo PA, and motivation. Analysis. Multivariate analysis of covariance and univariate analysis of covariance models were used, to compare the two study conditions on posttest outcomes, controlling for baseline levels. Results. Compared, with the. control group, the treatment group showed significant improvement. The multivariate test was significant (p < . 001), with a large effect size (η² = .42). The treatment group differed significantly from the control participants on 11 outcomes (p < .005), with large effect sizes for PA status, min/d, and knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intention. Medium effect sizes were measured for perceived barriers, depressive symptoms, motivation, and self-efficacy. Multiple visits resulted in significantly improved PA, motivation, self-efficacy, and intention, compared with one-time visits. Conclusions. The Get Moving Web site had positive effects and was well received. Interventions Web site have potential to increase the PA of sedentary individuals in worksites and elsewhere, but more research is needed into mediators of Web-based interventions.

AB- Purpose. To estimate the prevalence of U.S. children's overweight risk and obesity at age 9 months and at age 2 years, to assess weight changes between the two periods, and to examine relationships between weight status (i.e., normal, at risk, or obese) changes and demographic variables. Design. Analyses of children's early weight trajectories and related demographic characteristics from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) are presented. Setting. United States. Subjects. The 9-month-old (n = 8900) and 2-year-old (n = 7500) ECLS-B waves were used to generate nationally representative estimates of obese and at-risk children born in 2001. Measures. Measures included child's sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, community locale, geographic region, and weight status. Analysis. Logistic and multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of children's demographic characteristics being related to weight persistence, loss, or gain. Results. Approximately one-third of U.S. children were either at risk or obese at 9 months (31.9%) and at 2 years (34.3%). Some children were at greater risk (e.g., Hispanics and low socioeconomic status children), while others had reduced risk (e.g., females and Asian/Pacific Islanders). Additional results from two trajectory models generally corroborated patterns of status change due to weight gain. Conclusions. Between age 9 months and age 2 years, U. S. children consistently moved toward less desirable weight status. Obesity risk was not uniform across demographic subgroups, suggesting that health policy might focus on those children at greatest risk. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the long-term impact of a telephone-based weight management program among participants recruited from worksite settings. Design. Pre/post quasi-experimental design comparing weight loss and related behaviors between program completers and noncompleters. Setting. Ten large private-sector and public-sector employers. Subjects. Overweight or obese participants (n = 1298) enrolled in a telephone-based weight management program. Intervention. Individually tailored telephone-based weight management coaching program that included up to five calls over a median of 250 days. Measures. Weight, body mass index, and lifestyle behaviors assessed via health risk assessment at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Analysis. Chi-square and one-way analysis of variance procedures were used to assess between-group differences in weight and associated behaviors, with criterion for significance set at p < .05. Results. Among weight management program participants, 48% of program completers and 47% of noncompleters lost weight, but program completers averaged 2.6 times more weight loss than noncompleters. Improvements in physical activity, eating habits, and overall health status were reported for completers. Conclusion. The weight loss attained among participants who lost weight, along with the improvements in physical activity and nutrition practices, suggests that a telephone-based weight management program of modest intensity can have a positive impact on the health of obese or overweight worksite participants.

AB- Purpose. Explore the impact of dramatic budget cuts to the Florida Tobacco Control Program (FTCP) on Florida teens' exposure to tobacco control interventions. Design. Survey data on teens in Florida and a comparison sample of the remainder of the United States. Data were collected in six waves between 2002 and 2006, with three waves collected before and three waves collected after the FTCP budget cut in fiscal year (FY) 2004. Setting. Florida. Subjects. Twelve- to 17-year-old teens in Florida and the remainder of the United States. Between spring 2002 and summer 2006, 7841 interviews of Florida teens and 10,875 interviews of teens in the remainder of the United States were conducted. Measures. Exposure to FTCP interventions, including tobacco countermarketing, school, and community organizations, and in-school tobacco prevention curricula. Analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test whether declines in Florida youth's exposure to FTCP interventions were associated with the FTCP budget cut. Results. Following the FY2004 FTCP budget cut, there were greater declines in teens' exposure to tobacco countermarketing campaigns in Florida compared with the remainder of the United States (odds ratio [OR] = .42; p < .001). The FY2004 budget cut also may have had an impact on exposure to in-school tobacco prevention curricula and school youth organizations (OR= .67; p < .001). Conclusion. Program budget cuts in Florida resulted in significant declines in exposure to some FTCP interventions (particularly tobacco countermarketing). Research on the correlates of smoking suggests that these budget cuts could have a significant impact on tobacco-related outcomes among teens. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To test the effectiveness of ¡Vamos a Caminar! (Let's Walk!), an intervention for Mexican-American women living in economically disadvantaged, poorly urbanized areas in the South Texas border region. Design. This was a nonexperimental, one-group, pretest and posttest intervention with a duration of 12 weeks. Setting. The intervention was conducted in Hidalgo County, Texas, 1 of the 10 poorest, counties in the. United States, located at the border with Mexico. Participants resided in areas known as colonias, which are unincorporated and impoverished settlements along the border where many people live in trailers or self-built houses and lack basic services. Subjects. Spanish-speaking Mexican-American women (n = 16) 18 years of age and older. Intervention. The program was home-based, culturally sensitive, theoretically driven, and facilitated by community health workers. Measures. Changes in walking levels, depressive symptoms, and stress levels were assessed. Analysis. Descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test were used. Results. A majority of participants were unemployed, had low levels of education, were born in Mexico, and were obese. After exposure to the program, the participants reported a significant increase in walking (915.8 metabolic, equivalent min/wk; p = . 002) and lower depressive symptoms (p = . 055) and stress level scores (p = .017). Conclusions. Culturally sensitive programs promoting walking in underserved, minority populations are promising in reducing physical activity disparities. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot faith-based physical activity (PA) intervention for Latinos. Design. Randomized trial, with two churches receiving the intervention and one church serving as a comparison group. Setting. Three Catholic churches near Manhattan, Kansas. Subjects. A subsample of the congregation from the intervention churches (n = 24) and comparison church (n = 23) volunteered to take part in the assessment. Intervention. Culturally and spiritually relevant education materials and activities were developed promoting the health benefits of PA. Educational materials included flyers, bulletin inserts, and posters. An 8-week team based walking contest promoted social support for PA. A health "fiesta" provided hands-on educational opportunities for PA. Measures. Organizational and individual process evaluation outcomes were assessed at baseline and 6 months. Interviews with church contacts at 6 months documented successes and struggles with implementation. Individual-level variables assessed knowledge related to PA and exposure to the intervention. Analysis. Basic frequencies and descriptive statistics were used. Results. Compared with 36% of comparison participants, 66% of intervention participants identified health reasons for participating in PA, and 47% accurately described PA recommendations, compared with 16% of comparison participants. Process evaluation revealed implementation successes and struggles, including communication problems with church contacts and difficulty in creating a large exposure to intervention materials. Conclusions. This pilot study provides formative research for developing larger faith-based PA interventions targeting Latinos. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Nineteen randomly selected public schools in Melbourne, Australia. Subjects. Families of 5- to 6-year-old (n = 190) and 10- to 12-year-old (n = 350) children. Measures. In 2001, parents reported their participation in PA, family-based PA, and support and reinforcement for their child's PA. In 2001, 2004, and 2006, moderate to vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) was assessed among youth using accelerometers. Weekend and "critical window" (after school until 6:00 P.M.) MVP A were examined because we hypothesized that the family environment would most likely influence these behaviors. Analysis. Generalized estimating equations predicted average change in MVPA over 5 years from baseline family environment factors. Results. Maternal role modeling was positively associated with boys' critical window and weekend (younger boys) MVPA. Paternal reinforcement of PA was positively associated with critical window and weekend MVPA among all boys, and paternal direct support was positively associated with weekend MVPA (older boys). Among girls, maternal coparticipation in PA predicted critical window MVPA, and sibling coparticipation in PA was directly associated with weekend MVPA (younger girls). Conclusions. Longitudinal relationships, although weak in magnitude, were observed between the family environment and MVPA among youth. Interventions promoting maternal role modeling, paternal reinforcement of and support for PA, and maternal and sibling coparticipation in PA with youth are warranted. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Maternal and Child Health (MCH) experts emphasize the importance of preconception health (PCH) in achieving healthy pregnancies and positive birth outcomes. Research demonstrates that Latinas face significant PCH disparities, yet no comprehensive PCH promotion strategy exists to reach them. As a trusted community-based organization that uses culturally competent strategies to promote MCH in the Latino community, PASOs is well-positioned to address PCH among Latinos in South Carolina. With the input and support of Latino community members, PASOs is pioneering a PCH strategy using its successful model of education, outreach, partnerships and resource navigation.

AB- Purpose. This study tested a repeated-measures application of the Leading by Example (LBE) questionnaire, a self-report instrument measuring organizational leadership support for health promotion. Design. The efficacy of the LBE was tested, in a quasi-experimental health promotion, intervention trial. Twelve worksites were assigned to three intervention conditions (i.e., control, moderate, high intensity). Setting. The worksites were selected from a large U.S.-based chemical company. Subjects. Baseline data were collected from employees in various job roles in 2005 (N = 125). Follow-up data were collected in 2006 (N = 114) and 2007 (N = 106). Response rates ranged from 54% to nearly three-fourths of potential respondents. Intervention. Worksites assigned to both treatment conditions received changes in the built, environment via supports for weight management. Worksites assigned to the intense condition received additional elements designed to impact leadership's support for a positive health promotion climate. Measures. Four LBE factors measuring management support for health were assessed over time. Analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis H-test and analyses of variance/covariance were used to compare LBE scores. Results. Significant changes from baseline to 2006 were identified for the four factors (p = .000) of the LBE. No significant changes were found from 2006 to 2007. Conclusions. The LBE effectively captured perceptions of management support for health. Researchers and practitioners alike should consider using the LBE to track and evaluate perceptions of management support for health promotion. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To test inter-rater reliability and internal consistency of a reduced-item version of an environmental audit tool for physical-activity resources in a rural setting. Design. A cross-sectional design. Setting. Five rural school districts in western New York. Participants. A random sample of 391 street segments (i.e., the length of a street contained within a census block.) Fifty street segments were observed a second lime for a reliability analysis, Measure. The Pedestrian Environmental Data Scan (PEDS), a previously tested instrument for conducting audits of the built, environment for physical-activity supports, was used. Modifications were made for use in rural settings. Analysis. Four tests of reliability (Kappa [κ]; prevalence-adjusted, bias-adjusted κ [PABAK]; percent agreement; and Spearman rho [ρ]) and one test of internal consistency (Cronbach α) were used. Results. Nineteen measures were identified for their utility in the rural setting. These measures had an average κ of .43, an average PABAK of .72, and an average percent agreement of 86.2%, indicating good agreement. They were organized into four subscale areas that had Spearman ρ ranging from moderate (ρ = .38) to strong (ρ = .66). Alpha (α) values for the scale overall (α = .60) and subscales (range, .25-.66) suggested that items included were likely to be multi-dimensional. Conclusion. A simpler audit tool has been identified that might, be more appropriate for use in the rural setting. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study evaluated the economic impact of an online disease management program within a broader population health management strategy. Design. A retrospective, quasi-experimental, cohort design evaluated program participants and a matched cohort of nonparticipants on 2003-2007 claims data in a mixed model. Sample. The study was conducted through Highmark Inc., Blue Cross Blue Shield, covering 4.8 million members in five regions of Pennsylvania. Overall, 413 online self-management program participants were compared with a matched cohort of 360 nonparticipants. Measures. The costs and claims data were measured per person per calendar year. Total payments were aggregated from inpatient, outpatient, professional services, and pharmacy payments. The costs of the online program were estimated on a per-participant basis. All dollars were adjusted to 2008 values. Intervention. The online intervention, implemented in 2006, was a commercially available, tailored program for chronic condition self management, nested within the Blues on CallSM condition management strategy. Analysis. General linear modeling (with covariate adjustment) was used. Data trends were also explored using second-order polynomial regressions. Results. Health care costs per person per year were $757 less than predicted for participants relative to matched nonparticipants, yielding a return an investment of $9.89for every dollar spent on the program. Conclusions. This online intervention showed a favorable and cost-effective impact on health care cost. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Vietnamese-Americans (VA) constitute a large minority community that is mostly foreign born with limited English proficiency. This article compares the health content of free print media targeting VA with that of free English-language print media. Design. Content analysis. Setting. All free print media available at the three largest VA-serving supermarkets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were reviewed. Comparison English-language periodicals included free and purchased publications. Measures. We identified and coded 254 health content-containing articles from 22 issues of six periodicals (four free Vietnamese, one free English language, and one purchased English language) collected over a 4-week period. Analysis. Chi-square and t-tests for independent samples were used to compare free Vietnamese- and free English-language periodicals. Additional analyses included all English-language periodicals as the comparison group. Results. Higher proportions of advertisements and "pseudonews" articles (ads formatted like news stories) were found In free Vietnamese- vs. free English-language publications (overt ads, 61% vs. 28%; pseudonews, 18% vs. 0%). Moreover, Vietnamese-language publications did not contain many articles addressing diseases most commonly found in Asian-Americans. Discussion. The significant proportion made up by profit-motivated health content in VA print media points to an untapped, opportunity to provide evidence-based information about health topics of interest to this community. Future studies should, examine secular trends, assess multiple communities, and develop community-based participatory approaches to improving access to quality health information among minorities with limited English proficiency.

AB- Purpose. The leading causes of mortality among Hispanics living in the United Stales are smoking related. This study sought to systematically review smoking cessation interventions targeting healthy Hispanic adults living in the United States, to conduct a "mini" meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, and lo offer recommendations for future research. Data Sources. Studies were identified through computerized bibliographic databases (PsychINFO, PsycARTICLES, PsycFirst, MEDLINE, Science Direct, and Dissertation Abstracts Online), article reference lists, conference abstracts, and unpublished data through October 2008. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Evaluation of a smoking cessation intervention among healthy U.S. Hispanic adults. Studies included, in the meta-analysis were also required to be randomized controlled trials. Data Extraction. Twelve studies were eligible for the systematic review and five studies for the meta-analysis. Two independent raters coded each study. Data Synthesis. Interventions consisted of self-help, nicotine replacement therapy, and community-based interventions, as well as individual, group, and telephone counseling. There was evidence for the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions at the end, of treatment (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.16), which was attenuated in the longer term. Conclusions. Tobacco use among U.S. Hispanics is a growing public health concern. Smoking cessation interventions demonstrate promise among Hispanic adults living in the Untied States. More randomized trials evaluating tobacco interventions in this special population are warranted, with examination of the effect of cultural specificity and acculturation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine factors associated with smoking cessation at pregnancy onset In Hispanic women. Design. Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the prospective Latina Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Study. Setting. Public obstetrical practices of a medical center in Massachusetts, 2000-2004. Subjects. A total of 351 Hispanic (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients who smoked in the year prior to pregnancy. Measures. At enrollment, interviewers collected self-reported cigarette smoking prior to and during pregnancy and sociodemographic, health, and acculturation factors. Analysis. Logistic regression and backward elimination procedures were used to determine factors independently associated with quitting. Results. Forty-five percent of women reported quitting smoking at pregnancy onset. In multivariate analyses, women born outside the United States, women with a family history of diabetes, and non-Puerto Rican Hispanics were 32% to 54% more likely to quit smoking. Women with high stress, women with marijuana use, and parous women were 23% to 49% less likely to quit. Women who smoked 20+ cigarettes/d in prepregnancy were less likely to quit smoking (relative risk = .44; 95% confidence interval .27, .65) compared with light smokers. Age, income, body mass index, language preference, prepregnancy exercise, and alcohol consumption were not associated with quitting. Conclusions. Non-U.S. birthplace, family history of diabetes, and non-Puerto Rican ethnicity were associated with quitting smoking at pregnancy onset in Hispanic women. Prepregnancy marijuana use and smoking, parity, and stress were associated with continued smoking. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. The purpose of this paper is to critically review intervention studies that aimed to increase African-Americans' participation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Data Source. Potential studies were identified using a combination of key words in five computerized databases. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Articles were selected if they met all of the inclusion crileria: (1) The study's purpose was to test an intervention to increase CRC screening. (2) At least 50% of the sample was African-American. (3) The study focused on individuals 50 years and older. (4) The study was published between 2000 and 2008. Data Extraction. Abstracts and reference lists were scanned to determine relevance and a copy of the article was obtained. Data Synthesis. Data from each study were extracted and placed in a matrix for synthesis. Results. Interventions focused on recruitment from health care centers, churches, housing projects, and senior centers. Both direct and indirect strategies were used to identify the barriers to CRC screening. Conclusions. Findings suggest that interventions are most successful when they target individuals or communities, address known barriers to screening, deliver tailored messages, use multiple methods of message delivery, and are delivered over multiple time points.

AB- The article discusses a U.S. sin food tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and why the authors feel it is the right policy, but for the wrong reasons. According to the authors, as U.S. obesity rates rise, governments are employing a strategy known as the sin food tax to reduce consumption of calorie-dense foods of little nutritional value, called sin foods. The focus of the article is an investigation by the authors regarding the effectiveness of a sin food tax on SSBs in reducing obesity rates. Topics include the health effects of consuming SSBs, problematic assumptions with sin food taxation, such as the multiple causes of obesity, and what is necessary to effectively reduce obesity through sin food taxation.

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this study was to develop a self-report instrument to measure perceived physical and social environmental factors in the worksite setting that are shown to influence physical activity. Design. Initial items were generated from a review of the literature and were sent out for peer and expert panel review. A revised questionnaire was sent to 1250 participants to determine and lest the emerging factor structure. Setting. The instrument was tested at two worksites in the mid-South. Participants. Participants consisted of a random sample of regular full-time employees at the two worksites. Measures. Principal axis factoring with a varimax rotation was used to explore the data in the first group of participants. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the fit of the final model in the second group of participants. Measures used included the comparative fit index, parsimony goodness of fit index, root mean square error of approximation, and the root mean square residual. Results. The final analysis showed an adequate fit of the data to the hypothesized factor structure (n = 683). The instrument showed good internal consistency, temporal stability, construct reliability, and discriminant validity. Conclusion. The Worksite Supportive Environments for Active Living Survey is a reliable and valid tool for investigating perception of the worksite environment related to physical activity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To provide evidence about the types of transportation infrastructure that support bicycling. Design. Population-based survey with pictures to depict 16 route types. Setting. Metro Vancouver, Canada. Subjects. 1402 adult current and potential cyclists, i.e., the "near market"for cycling (representing 31% of the population). Measures. Preference scores for each infrastructure type (scale from - 1, very unlikely to use, to + 1, very likely to use); current frequency of use of each infrastructure type (mean number of times/y). Analyses. Descriptive statistics across demographic segments; multiple linear regression. Results. Most respondents were likely or very likely to choose to cycle on the following broad route categories: off-street paths (71%-85% of respondents); physically separated routes next to major roads (71%); and residential routes (48%-65%). Rural roads (21%-49%) and routes on major streets (16%-52%) were least likely to be chosen. Within the broad categories, routes with traffic calming, bike lanes, paved surfaces, and no on-street parking were preferred, resulting in increases in likelihood of choosing the route from 12% to 37%. Findings indicate a marked disparity between preferred cycling infrastructure and the route types that were currently available and commonly used. Conclusion. This study provides evidence for urban planners about bicycling infrastructure designs that could lead to an increase in active transportation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Determine if recruitment methods are differentially related to the reach of a physical activity program in metro/urban vs. rural settings. Design. Cross-sectional survey. Setting. Kansas counties. Subjects. Ninety-four Cooperative Extension agents responsible for 102 counties. Measures. Promotional score, task force activity, and years of program delivery were assessed using a self-report survey. Reach was assessed for each county by dividing the number of participants by intended population using census data. Analysis. Rural/urban comparisons on reach were completed using a Mann-Whitney test. Multiple linear regression models were used to determine the relationship between independent variables and participation rate by setting type. Results. Metro/urban counties had lower mean participation rates than rural counties (z = -4.5; p < .001). In metro/urban counties, the regression on participation rate was significant (R² = .19; F = 4.09; p = .011), but only promotional score significantly contributed to the model (p = .003). In rural counties, the regression was also significant (R² = .34; F 6.64; p = .001), with task force activity and years of delivery making significant contributions (p = .001 and p = .01 7, respectively). Conclusion. Interpersonal methods may be more effective in recruiting physical activity program participants in rural settings, whereas using a greater variety of promotional methods may be more effective in metro/urban settings.

AB- Purpose. Investigate the extent to which risk of weight gain is affected by emotional health. Also, determine the influence of age, baseline weight, physical activity (PA), energy intake, and changes in PA and energy intake on the relationship between emotional health and weight gain. Design. Prospective cohort. Setting. Two metropolitan areas in the Mountain West. Subjects. Total of 256 middle-aged, apparently healthy women. Measures. Emotional health was assessed using the General Well-Being Schedule. PA was measured using Actigraph accelerometers. Energy intake was measured using 7-day weighed food records. All assessments were taken at baseline and again at the follow-up approximately 2 years later. Analysis. Relative risk (RR) was calculated using incidence data. Results. With no variables controlled, women with less than positive (LTP) emotional health had 59% greater risk of weight gain (≥ 2 kg) than women with positive emotional health (RR, 1.59; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.04-2.44). After adjustments for each potential confounder individually, risk of weight gain did not change significantly. However, adjusting for all of the potential confounders simultaneously weakened the risk of weight gain (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, .93-2.21). Risk of weight gain (≥ 2 kg) was no greater in depressed women compared with their counterparts. Conclusion. Middle-aged women with LTP emotional health are at significantly increased risk of weight gain over time compared with women with positive emotional health. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Assess whether a convenient care clinic (CCC) medical weight-loss program can promote weight loss. Design. Prospective cohort study with follow-up at 10 weeks. Setting. A CCC (Lindora Health Clinic) weight-loss program (Lean for Life) based in a retail pharmacy (Rite Aid Pharmacy) in Costa Mesa, California. Subjects. The first 100 people to purchase the weight-loss program. Intervention. A 10-week, $465 medical weight-loss program with individual counseling sessions; a hypocaloric diet of 900 to 1200 kcal/day (25 %-30% carbohydrates, 40% protein, 25% fat); and adjunctive pharmacologic treatment, if necessary. Measures. We collected data on age, height, weight, visits per week, medication use, comorbid conditions, and weight change. Analysis. Data were analyzed based on length of enrollment and mean percent weight loss. Statistical tests used were t-test and Spearman rank correlation test. Results. Eighty-six subjects had valid data entries for weight change over the 10-week period. Average age was 51.6 years; mean starting body mass index was 30.3. Thirty patients participated for 0 to 4 weeks, 30 for 4 to 9 weeks, and 26 for 10 weeks. Mean percent weight changes for the 0 to 4, 5 to 9, and 10-week grasps were - 1.6, -6.0, and -8. 1, respectively. Forty-five (45%) of the patients achieved medically significant weight loss (≥ 5%). Conclusion. The study shows that a medical weight-loss program offered at a CCC in a retail pharmacy can produce medically significant weight loss of ≥ 5%. Further research of collaborations between the retail and medical weight-loss industries is warranted. Study design limitations included selection bias and confounding variables other than the weight-loss program. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study employed qualitative research to describe the relationship between spirituality and overall health among a sample of Latino women. A framework is presented for understanding this complex relationship. Design. Findings are presented from a qualitative analysis of six 1.5-hour focus group sessions. Setting. The research was conducted among Latino women living in Chicago, Illinois, and Northeastern New York communities. We employed a community-based participatory research approach in which community members were active participants throughout the research process. Subjects. Subjects were 47 Latino women 31 to 81 years, all of whom were Christian and the majority (43%) of whom had less than a high school education. Twenty-seven percent reported having high school diplomas, and the same percentage reported at least some college. Of the women who answered the questions, one did not have health insurance, 69% had public health insurance, and 29% had private health insurance. Measures. Grounded theory using selective coding was employed to understand the relationship between spirituality and health and to develop the conceptual framework. Results. Spirituality was expressed as a vital component of health, and the belief in a need for balance of physical, mental, and spiritual health was described. An active and a passive relationship between spirituality and health emerged, with active being most common. Asking God for help or faith as a coping strategy were subdomains of the active relationship, and God responsible for health fell under the passive domain. These relationship types influenced beliefs about participation in one own health. Conclusion. The findings that emerged contribute to an understanding of how spirituality plays a role in health beliefs among Latino women, which has implications for health promotion research and program development for addressing health disparities.

AB- Purpose. To study informal skill transfer via staff networks as a complement to formal training among afterschool childcare providers implementing a health promotion program. Design. Cross-sectional, sociometric network analysis. Setting. Boston Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) after-school programs implementing the iPLAY program. Participants. All 91 staff members at 20 sites were eligible; 80 completed the survey (88% response rate). Measures. At the network level, network density measured system-level connectedness. At the staff level, the independent variable was out degree, the number of individuals to whom respondents noted a program-related connection. The dependent variable was skill gains, the number of key implementation skills gained from the network. Analysis. We mapped the staff program-related social network. We utilized multiple linear regression to estimate the relationship between out degree and skill gains, and we adjusted for clustering of staff in sites. Results. Most staff (77%) reported gaining at least one skill from the network, but only 2% of potential network connections were established. The regression model showed that out degree (i.e., number of program-related contacts) was significantly associated with skill gains (β = .48, p < .01) independent of other variables. Conclusion. Informal skill transfer in staff networks may be a useful complement to formal training for implementation of health promotion programs, but informal skill transfer was likely underutilized in this network. Future research employing longitudinal and/or multi-site data should examine these findings in greater detail. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To evaluate the psychometric characteristics of the Research on Urban Trail Environments (ROUTES) Trail Use Questionnaire. Design. Test-retest reliability was assessed by repeated measures (study 1); validity was assessed by comparing reported trail use to self-reported and objectively measured physical activity (PA) levels (study 2). Setting. Study 1: a religious institution situated near a Los Angeles trail. Study 2: 1-mile buffer zones surrounding three urban trails (Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles). Subjects. Thirty-four adults between 40 and 60 years of age (10 men and 24 women) completed the ROUTES questionnaire twice (study 1) Study 2 participants were 490 adults (48% female and 73% white), mean age 48 years. Measures. Trail use for recreation and transportation purposes, time and distance spent on trails, and characteristics of the trail and other trail users. PA was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and accelerometry. Analyses. Pearson correlation coefficients and κ statistics were used for test-retest reliability for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate hypotheses on PA comparing trail users and nonusers. Results. Test-retest statistics were acceptable (κ = .57, r = .66). Validity was supported by correlations between indices of trail use with self-reported PA and accelerometry, and significant group differences between trail users and nonusers in PA levels. Conclusions. The ROUTES Trail Use Questionnaire demonstrated good reliability and validity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Designing programs far mid-life to older adults whose sedentary behaviors are associated with increased health risks is crucial. The U.S. Task Force on Community Preventive Services strongly recommends individually adapted behavior change programs as one approach to increasing physical activity in communities. The purpose of this study is to report challenges organizations faced when translating two evidence-based programs in real-world settings, adaptations made, and whether or not fidelity was negatively impacted by these adaptations. Design: A grounded theory approach to qualitative research was used. Setting and Participants: Nine community organizations across the country participated. Two organizations had more than one site participating, for a total of 12 sites from nine organizations. Within those organizations, 2796 participants were part of the program during the first 2 years. Participants were underactive (i.e., not meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American College of Sports Medicine recommendations) mid- to older-aged adults. Methods: Community organizations participated in monthly conference calls, and program information was entered into an electronic database regularly. Data obtained from the calls and database were used for analyses. Results: Challenges and adaptations emerged in three categories: (1) program logistics, (2) program theory, and (3) program philosophy. Conclusion: Challenges were present for community organizations; however, with some level of adaptation, the community organizations were able to effectively deliver and maintain fidelity in two evidence-based physical activity programs to a large and diverse group of mid-to older-aged adults.

AB- Purpose. Food environments affect people's food-related decisions, consumption, and health outcomes. This paper critiques instruments available for assessing food environments to help researchers, practitioners, and community organizations select those that best meet their needs, resources, and level of expertise. Gaps and recommendations for future instrument development are discussed. Method. Instruments were selected by reviewing the literature and contacting researchers and practitioners. Using the social-ecological model, the instruments were classified according to the type of food environments they assess. Each instrument is rated according to criteria for ease of use, detail, resources required, and psychometric testing. Results. Of the 48 instruments identified, only 39% were tested for validity or reliability. Observational tools were the largest category of instruments developed. Fifty-two percent of the instruments provide some level of technical assistance and 37% are considered appropriate for community members. Conclusion. Three distinct groups want to assess food environments: researchers, practitioners, and community organizations. These groups have different information needs and different capacities to undertake assessments. At this time there is a tradeoff between simplicity and low cost on the one hand, and detail and accuracy on the other. To choose the most suitable instrument, users should consider the pros and cons of each instrument and base their selection on purpose of their assessment, resources and expertise at hand, and validity, reliability, and ease of use of the instrument.

AB- Purpose. To investigate influences on shopping and eating behavior of Hmong adults living in St. Paul/ Minneapolis, Minnesota. Design and Setting. Conducted a mapping project, food surveys, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and focus groups (n = 11). Subjects. Subjects were assigned to three groups. The B-TL¹ group was made up of subjects who were born in Thailand/Laos and had lived in the US ≤ years (n = 19). The B-TL² group was made up of subjects who were born in Thailand/Laos, had food memories, and had lined in the US >5 years (n = 20). The B-US group was made up of subjects who were born and/or raised in the US (n = 30). Methods. Using Geographical Informational Systems software, 15 grocery stares were mapped and surveyed. Food prices were compared with the consumer price index (CPI). The FFQ assessed food consumption patterns. Focus group transcripts were evaluated for themes and coded. Degree of acculturation was assessed by adapting a previously developed instrument. Results. The population is concentrated in St. Paul, coinciding with store density. Limited foods had CPIs and some CPIs were outdated. B-US had significantly higher levels of dietary acculturation than B-TL² and B-TL¹, with B-TL² also having a higher dietary acculturation level compared with B-TL¹. Acculturation of the Hmong into the American food system, determinants of store type, and Hmong food's having a mainstream factor were identified themes. Conclusions. B-US and B-TL² shopped at American stores more than did B-TL¹ because of convenience, one-stop shopping, and increased English fluency. Hmong foods have entered the Amen can food system and are sold at Asian and American stores. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine effectiveness of a Web-based, stage-tailored folic acid intervention compared to non-stage-tailored education to promote folic acid-containing multivitamin use among college women. Design. Pretest/posttest with random assignment to groups. Setting. Internet-based on college campus. Participants. Female college students (n = 408; mean age ± SD = 20.8 ± 2.6; range 18-29 years). Intervention. Transtheoretical Model-based folic acid modules delivered over 4 weeks. Traditional brochure formatted online for nontailored group. Measures. Questionnaire assessing stage of change, self-efficacy, and decisional balance. Analysis. Chi-square test and logistic regression. Results. Of the participants who reported not taking a multivitamin at pretest, a greater proportion of participants in the tailored group (32.6%; n = 47) reported taking a multivitamin at positest than in the nontailored group (19.9%; n = 27), X²(1, n = 280) = 5.9, p = .015. At posttest tailored intervention participants were 2.5 times more likely to be in a later stage of change (odds ratio [OR] = 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52, 3.99; p = .0003) and 2.3 times more likely to be in action (OR = 2.27; 95% CI = 1.28, 4.01; p .005) than nontailored participants. They also had greater increases in self-efficacy and pros. Movement from precontemplation to a later stage occurred significantly more often in the tailored than in the nontailored group. Conclusion. Stage-tailored vs. traditional folic acid education was more effective in improving stage of readiness to consume a folic acid-containing multivitamin. The Internet was a successful medium for targeting college females for preconception health care education. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine whether a multicomponent nutrition intervention program at a corporate site reduces body weight and improves other cardiovascular risk factors in overweight individuals. Design. Prospective clinical intervention study. Subjects/Setting. Employees of the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO) (N = 113), aged 21 to 65 years, with a body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m² and/or previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Intervention. A 22-week intervention including a low-fat, vegan diet. Measures. Changes in body weight, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, lipid profile, and dietary intake. Analysis. Multivariate analyses of variance were calculated for clinical and nutrient measures, followed by univariate analyses of variance, to determine the significance of differences between groups in changes over time. Results. Intervention-group participants experienced greater weight changes compared with control-group participants (mean, -5.1 [SE, .6] kg vs. + .1 [SE, .6] kg, p < .0001), as well as greater changes in waist circumference (mean, -4. 7 [SE, .6] cm vs. + .8 [SE, .6] cm, p < .0001) and waist:hip ratio (mean, - .006 [SE, .003] vs. + .014 [SE, .005], p = .0007). Weight loss of 5% of body weight was more frequently observed in the intervention group (48.5%) compared with the control group (11.1%) (X²[1, N = 113] = 16.99, p < .0001). Conclusions. Among individuals volunteering for a 22-week worksite research study, an intervention using a low-fat, vegan diet effectively reduced body weight and waist circumference. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To address the translational research question regarding the optimal intervention "dose" to produce the most cost-effective rate of weight loss, we conducted the Drop It At Last (DIAL) study. Design. DIAL is a 6-month pilot randomized trial to examine the efficacy of phone-based weight loss programs with varying levels of treatment contact (10 vs. 20 sessions) in comparison to self-directed treatment. Setting. Participants were recruited from the community via mailings and advertisement. Subjects. Participants were 63 adults with a body mass index between 30 and 39 kg/m². Intervention. Participants received a standard set of print materials and were randomized to either: (1) self-directed treatment; (2) 10 phone coaching sessions; or (3) 20 phone coaching sessions. Measures. Measured height, weight, and psychosocial and weight-related self-monitoring measures were collected at baseline and follow-up. Analysis. General linear models were used to examine 6-month treatment group differences in weight loss and in psychosocial and behavioral measures. Results. Weight losses were -2.3, -3.2, and -4.9 kg in the self-directed, 10-session, and 20- session groups, respectively (p < .21). Participants who completed 10 or more sessions lost more weight (-5.1 kg) compared to those completed four or fewer sessions (- .3 kg, p < .04). Conclusion. Phone-based weight loss program participation is associated with modest weight loss. The optimal dose and timing of intervention warrant further study. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study measured the effect of demographic and clinical characteristics on health and cultural beliefs related to mammography. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. Interviews were conducted during 2003 and 2004 in a Midwestern urban area. Subjects. Subjects were 344 low-income African-American women 40 years and older who had not had mammography within the previous 18 months. Measures. The instrument measured personal characteristics, belief and knowledge scales, and participants' mammography experience and plans. Analysis. Multiple regression analysis assessed the effect of specific demographic and clinical characteristics on each of the scale values and on subjects' stages of readiness to change. Results. The subjects' levels of education significantly affected six of the 12 belief and knowledge scales. Higher-educated women felt less susceptible to breast cancer, had higher self- efficacy, had less fear, had lower fatalism scores, were less likely to be present-time oriented, and were more knowledgeable about breast cancer. Older women felt they were less susceptible to breast cancer, had higher fatalism scores, were more present-time oriented, and were less knowledgeable about breast cancer. Conclusions. The findings suggest that mammography promotion programs for African- Americans should consider the education levels and ages of the target women to be most effective. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Identify an efficient method of creating a comprehensive and concise measure of the built environment integrating data from geographic information systems (GIS) and the Senior Walking Environmental Assessment Tool (SWEAT). Design. Cross-sectional study using a population sample. Setting. Eight municipally defined neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon. Subjects. Adult residents (N = 120) of audited segments (N = 363). Measures. We described built environmental features using SWEAT audits and GIS data. We obtained information on walking behaviors and potential confounders through in-person interviews. Analysis. We created two sets of environmental measures, one based on the conceptual framework used to develop SWEAT and another using principal component analysis (PCA). Each measure's association with walking for transportation and exercise was then assessed and compared using logistic regression. Results. A priori measures (destinations, safety, aesthetics, and functionality) and PCA measures (accessibility, comfort/safety, maintenance, and pleasantness) were analogous in conceptual meaning and had similar associations with walking. Walking for transportation was associated with destination accessibility and functional elements, whereas walking for exercise was associated with maintenance of the walking area and protection from traffic. However, only PCA measures consistently reached statistical significance. Conclusion. The measures created with PCA were more parsimonious than those created a priori. Performing PCA is an efficient method of combining and scoring SWEAT and GIS data. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To explore the feasibility of engaging community businesses in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention. Design. Randomly selected business owners/managers were asked to display discreetly wrapped condoms and brochures, both of which were provided free-of-charge for 3 months. Assessments were conducted at baseline, mid- program, and post-program. Customer feed back was obtained through an online survey. Setting. Participants were selected from a San Diego, California neighborhood with a high rate of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Participants. Fifty-one business owners/managers who represented 10 retail categories, and 52 customers. Measures. Participation rates, descriptive characteristics, number of condoms and brochures distributed, customer feedback, business owners'/managers' program satisfaction, and business owners'/managers' willingness to provide future support for HIV prevention were measured. Analysis. Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Fisher's exact, and McNemar's tests were used to analyze data. Results. The 20 business owners/managers (39%) who agreed to distribute condoms and brochures reported fewer years in business and more employees than those who agreed only to distribute brochures (20%) or who refused to participate (41 %; p < .05). Bars were the easiest of ten retail categories to recruit. Businesses with more employees and customers distributed more condoms and brochures (p < .05). More than 90% of customers supported distributing condoms and brochures in businesses, and 96% of business owners/managers described their program experience as positive. Conclusion. Businesses are willing to distribute condoms and brochures to prevent HIV. Policies to increase business participation in HIV prevention should be developed and tested. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine the influence of an environmental intervention to prevent excess weight gain in African-American children. Design. Single-group repeated measures. Setting. The intervention was delivered to a school composed of African-American children. Participants. Approximately 45% (N = 77) of enrolled second through sixth grade students. Intervention. The 18-month intervention was designed to alter the school environment to prevent excess weight gain by making healthier eating choices and physical activity opportunities more available. Measures. Body mass index percentile was the primary outcome variable. Body mass index z score was also calculated, and percent body fat, using bioelectrical impedance, was also measured. Total caloric intake (kilocalories) and percent kilocalories from fat, carbohydrate, and protein were measured by digital photography. Minutes of physical activity and sedentary behavior were self-reported. Analysis. Mixed-models analysis was used with covarying baseline values. Results. Boys maintained, whereas girls increased, percent body fat over 18 months (p = .027). All children decreased percent of kilocalories consumed from total and saturated fat and increased carbohydrate intake and self-reported physical activity during the intervention (p < .025). Body mass index z score, sedentary behavior, and total caloric intake were unchanged. Conclusion. The program may have resulted in maintenance of percent body fat in boys. The percent body fat in girls steadily increased, despite similar behavioral changes as boys. School-based interventions targeting African-American children should investigate strategies that can be effective across gender. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To investigate the relationship of sociodemographic and economic characteristics to tobacco expenses among Moroccan daily smokers. Design. Cross-sectional ("Maroc Tabagisme" Survey) study. Setting. Random sample of 9195 subjects representative of the Moroccan population. Subjects. Household subjects 15 years and older. Measures. Data were collected from selected households using a questionnaire about smoking, educational level, occupation, and household monthly income. Analysis. Associations between sociodemographic and economic characteristics, smoking status, and tobacco expenses were assessed by multivariate analysis in a sample of 5959 respondents who provided details about their family income. Results. Of 5959 participants, 28.5% of men and 2.8% of women were daily smokers. Compared with students, the odds of daily smoking were higher among blue-collar workers (odds ratio, 2.66). Tobacco expenses increased with higher family monthly income (p < .001). Moreover, smokers whose family monthly income was less than 1000 Moroccan dirham (MAD) spent 50.9% on tobacco, while those with family monthly income of 6000 MAD or higher spent 13.0% on tobacco. Conclusions. There was a strong association between tobacco expenses and sociodemographic and economic characteristics. Among households with low monthly income, up to half of the monthly income is spent on tobacco. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Test the applicability of the transtheoretical model (TTM) to adult fruit/vegetable consumption. Design. Cross-sectional random-digit dial survey. Setting. Hawaii. Subjects. 700(62.6% female; age [mean ± SD], 47 ± 17.1 years; education [mean ± SD], 14.6 ± 2.8 years; 35.0% white, 31.1% Asian, 22.1% native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 11.8% other). Measures. Stages, processes, self-efficacy, decisional balance, and self-reported fruit/vegetable consumption. Analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis tested the factor structure. Analyses of variance were used to explore stage differences in constructs. Results. Stage distribution was precontemplation (33%), contemplation (4%), preparation (37%), action (3%), and maintenance (23%). A 10-factor process model with two higher-order correlated factors (experiential and behavioral) provided the best data fit (χ² = 1446.12; df= 366; p < .0001; comparative fit index [CEI] = .89; standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = .05). The self-efficacy structure fit the data well (χ² = 81.86; df= 9; p < .0001; CFI= .94; SRMR= .04), as did the decisional balance structure (χ² = 37.42; df= 19; p = .007; CFI= .99; SRMR = .02). Processes, self-efficacy, decisional balance, and fruit/vegetable consumption behavior differed significantly by stage, with medium effect sizes for most variables. Conclusion. The variables revealed adequate fit to the theorized measurement models. TTM predictions regarding stage differences in self-efficacy, pros and cons, and fruit/vegetable consumption were confirmed; however, most experiential and behavioral processes increased in the early stages and then leveled off.

AB- Purpose. To examine the prevalence of health behaviors, including clinical preventive services and lifestyle risk behaviors, among insured workers and to determine whether disparities in health behaviors based on demographic factors exist among this group. Design. Cross-sectional analysis of 2004-2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. Setting. United States. Subjects. A representative sample of noninstitutionalized employed and insured adults aged 18 to 64 years (139,738 in 2004 and 159,755 in 2005). Measures. Self-reported clinical preventive services utilization and lifestyle-related behaviors, as well as multiple logistic regression analyses assessing the independent effects of demographic and access variables on health behaviors. Results. Among insured workers, rates of not using recommended clinical preventive services ranged from 8.5% (cervical cancer screening) to 73.9% (influenza vaccination). Rates for engaging in lifestyle-related risks ranged from 5.5% (heavy drinking) to 77.1% (inadequate fruit-vegetable consumption). In multivariate analyses, lower income, lower education, cost as a barrier to health care, and no health care provider were associated with significantly decreased clinical preventive services utilization (p < .01). Lower education and no health care provider were associated with lifestyle-related risks (p < .01). Conclusions. Working insured adults are not meeting recommendations for health behaviors. Significant disparities in health behaviors related to socioeconomic status exist among this group. Employers and insurers should consider these poor health behaviors and disparities when designing insurance benefits addressing clinical preventive services utilization and workplace health promotion programs addressing lifestyle-related behaviors.

AB- Purpose. To determine self-identified barriers to cancer screening participation in Montana among respondents to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Design. The 2007 BRFSS survey. Setting. State of Montana. Subjects. A total of 3433 respondents (2029 women) 50 years and older. Measures. Respondents who had never had an endoscopy and women who had not had a recent mammogram were asked why they had not been screened. Analysis. Associations between health care access variables and screening participation were assessed using χ² tests. Joint effects of multiple independent predictors of screening participation were assessed using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from multiple logistic regression analysis. Results. The strongest predictor of hasting an endoscopy (OR, 23.62; 95% CI, 18.42-30.28) or recent mammogram (OR, 10.87; 95%, CI, 6.42-18.40) was provider recommendation. The most common reasons for not being screened were respondent's belief that it was not necessary (44% for endoscopy and 39% for mammography), no provider recommendation (22% for endoscopy), and cost (12% for endoscopy and 19% for mammography). Among unscreened respondents whose providers recommended endoscopy and mammography, 30% and 36%, respectively, believed that it was not necessary. Conclusions. Many Montanans remain unaware of the importance of cancer screening. Health care providers and public health officials must increase patient education, and providers must continue to refer patients for screening. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To better understand the relationship between health insurance coverage and health care behaviors of persons with potentially disabling conditions enrolled in a state high- risk insurance pool. Design. Six focus groups with risk pool enrollees at two sites. Setting. Suburban areas in the state of Kansas. Participants. Forty-two individuals 29 to 62 years, all with potentially disabling physical or mental health conditions. Method. Qualitative analysis of focus group transcripts using pile sorting and theme identification. Results. High premiums and deductibles limit participants' ability to afford basic health services and access to prescription medications despite their middle-class socioeconomic status. Participants report delaying or forgoing needed medical care because of lack of coverage and/or out-of-pocket costs. They employ numerous and potentially dangerous strategies to minimize costs, especially for prescription medications. Some report "saving up" needed procedures until their total costs will exceed that year's deductible. Conclusion. Individuals in the risk pool were making medical decisions on the basis of cost rather than need. Many shared stories of medical complications as a result of delayed care and most expressed stress related to the difficulty of making decisions about their care and use of prescribed medications. The individual, nongroup insurance market, with its higher out-of-pocket costs, may not meet the needs of people with chronic health conditions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine the effects of an after-school NutriActive program on anthropometric measurements, motor skills, and fitness levels of young children. Design. In this quasi-experimental study, anthropometric, motor skill, and fitness measurements were compared between intervention and control students at baseline, following a 4-week intervention, and after a summer break (4 months). Setting. Two intervention and two control microurban elementary schools. Subjects. Forty-two intervention and 28 control kindergarten and first-grade students (50% boys, 82% Caucasian). Intervention. A 4-week program consisted daily of a morning walk and an after-school physical activity lesson with an emphasis on motor skill development, nutrition/health lesson, snack, and nonstructured active play. Measures. Body mass index, waist circumference, and fitness and motor skill levels. Analysis. Repeated-measures analysis of variance, t-test, and stepwise regression. Results. The intervention group scored significantly better on some fitness and all motor skill tests at 4 weeks. The improvements in fitness and skill levels ranged from 30% to 270%. At 4 months, differences between the groups diminished but remained significant, with better scores for the intervention group on some tests. Skill levels emerged as predictors of cardiovascular fitness at 4 months. Anthropometric measurements did not differ between the groups at any time point. Conclusion. A short, intense after-school program can produce significant, sustainable improvements in motor skill and fitness levels of young children. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- The article discusses so-called Value-Based Design (VBD) in the creation of preventative health services and health counseling plans by companies for their employees. Such plans encourage better health behavior by employees by offering incentives such as lower health insurance premium charges. Use of VBD by the firm Pitney Bowes and the municipal government of Asheville, North Carolina is examined, particularly the research used to identify groups of employees who had health risks which could be minimized through changed health behavior. The need for collaboration between employers and the health counseling firms who implement the plans is stressed.

AB- Purpose. To determine whether five behaviors shown to predict low fat intake in adults predicted low fat intake among economically disadvantaged African-American adolescents. Design. Cross-sectional. Subjects and Measures. Recruited through youth services agencies serving low-income communities in New York and New Jersey, participants were 265 African-American adolescents aged 10 to 14 years. Participants completed the Block Fat Screener and scales for measuring the following behaviors: avoiding fat as a seasoning modifying meat to make it lower in fat, substituting high-fat foods with manufactured low-fat equivalents, replacing high-fat foods with fruits and vegetables, and replacing high-fat foods with low-fat foods other than fruits and vegetables. Analysis. The reliability and construct validity of the scales were assessed using internal consistency reliability and correlation analyses. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine behavioral predictors of low fat intake. Results. Scale coefficient alphas ranged from .60 to .80. Fat avoidance, substitution, and replacement with fruits and vegetables were significantly associated with fat intake. The regression equation containing these behaviors accounted for 12% of the variance in intake. All three behaviors were significant predictors of low fat intake. Conclusions. Fewer behaviors have salience for predicting low fat intake among economically disadvantaged African-American adolescents than among adults. Interventions to lower youths' intake should emphasize fat avoidance, substitution, and replacement with fruits and vegetables. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. To conduct a systematic review of the literature to examine the influence of the built environment (BE) on the physical activity (PA) of adults in rural settings. Data Source. Key word searches of Academic Search Premier, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Sport Discus were conducted. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Studies published prior to June 2008 were included if they assessed one or more elements of the BE, examined relationships between the BE and PA, and focused on rural locales. Studies only reporting descriptive statistics or assessing the reliability of measures were excluded. Data Extraction. Objective(s), sample size, sampling technique, geographic location, and definition of rural were extracted from each study. Methods of assessment and outcomes were extracted from the quantitative literature, and overarching themes were identified from the qualitative literature. Data Synthesis. Key characteristics and findings from the data are summarized in Tables 1 through 3. Results. Twenty studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Positive associations were found among pleasant aesthetics, trails, safety/crime, parks, and walkable destinations. Conclusions. Research in this area is limited. Associations among elements of the BE and PA among adults appear to differ between rural and urban areas. Considerations for future studies include identifying parameters used to define rural, longitudinal research, and more diverse geographic sampling. Development and refinement of BE assessment tools specific to rural locations are also warranted. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and effectiveness of an intensive cardiac rehabilitation program in improving health outcomes in multiple sites. Methods. This study employs a nonexperimental (prospective time series) design to investigate changes in cardiovascular disease in 2974 men and women from 24 socioeconomically diverse sites who participated in an intensive cardiac rehabilitation program at baseline, 12 weeks, and 1 year. Paired t-tests were used to assess differences by comparing baseline values to those after 12 weeks, baseline values to those after 1 year, and values after 12 weeks to those after 1 year. Results. Eighty-eight percent of patients remained enrolled in the program after 12 weeks, and 78.1 % remained enrolled in the program after 1 year. Patients showed statistically significant improvements after 12 weeks in body mass index (BMJ), triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, depression, hostility, exercise, and functional capacity. These differences also remained significant after 1 year. There was additional significant improvement between 12 weeks and 1 year only in BMJ, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, functional capacity, and hostility, and significant recidivism between 12 weeks and 1 year in all other measures (except triglycerides) and depression, yet improvements from baseline to 1 year remained significant in all measures (except HDL, which was unchanged) (p < .005). Conclusions. This intensive cardiac rehabilitation program was feasible and sustainable for most patients who enrolled and was associated with numerous subjective and objective improvements in health outcomes. It demonstrates that the inteivention works when it is administered by staff at multiple clinical/community sites in four different states. These improvements were also seen in patients 65 years of age or older. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To evaluate the effects of a 12-week e-mail intervention promoting physical activity and nutrition, and to describe participant use and satisfaction feedback. Design. A longitudinal, randomized trial. Setting. Five large workplaces in Alberta, Canada. Participants. One thousand forty-three participants completed all three assessments, and 1263 participants in the experimental group provided use and satisfaction feedback after receiving the 12-week intervention. Intervention. Paired physical activity and nutrition messages were e-mailed weekly to the experimental group. The control group received all messages in bulk (i.e., within a single e-mail message) at the conclusion of the intervention. Measures. Self-report measures of knowledge, cognitions, and behaviors related to physical activity and nutrition were used. Satisfaction with e-mail messages was assessed at Time 2. Analysis. Planned contrasts compared the experimental group measures at Time 3 with those reported at Time 2 and with control group measures reported at Time 3. Control group measures at Time 3 were also compared with control group measures at Time 2. Results. The small intervention effects previously reported between Time 1 and Time 2 were maintained at Time 3. Providing the e-mail messages in bulk also had a significant positive effect on many of the physical activity and nutrition variables. Conclusions. E-mail offers a promising medium for promoting health-enhancing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Additional research is needed to determine optimal message dose and content. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Little is known about obesity-related health issues among American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) populations. Approach. A large cohort of AIAN people was assembled to evaluate factors associated with health. Setting. The study was conducted in Alaska and on the Navajo Nation. Participants. A total of 11,293 AIAN people were included. Methods. We present data for body mass index (BMJ, kg/m²) and waist circumference (cm) to evaluate obesity-related health factors. Results. Overall, 32.4% of the population were overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m²), 47.1 % were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²), and 21.4% were very obese (BMI, ≥ 35 kg/m²). A waist circumference greater than 102 cm for men and greater than 88 cm for women was observed for 41.7% of men and 78.3% of women. Obese people were more likely to perceive their health as fair/poor than nonobese participants (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.91; 95% CI, 1.71-2.14). Participants younger than 30 years were three times more likely to perceive their health as being fair or poor when their BMJ results were 35 or greater compared with those whose BMJ results were less than 25 kg/m². A larger BMI was associated with having multiple medical conditions, fewer hours of vigorous activity, and more hours of television watching. Conclusions. Given the. high rates of obesity in AIAN populations and the association of obesity with other health conditions, it is important to reduce obesity among AIAN people. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Satisfaction is understudied in weight loss programs. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between participant/program experiences and satisfaction with a weight loss intervention. Design. A prospective cohort design was utilized. Setting. The study was conducted in the Minneapolis metro area. Sample. Participants were obese employees of a managed care organization. One hundred were enrolled, and 78 had complete data available. Intervention. Treatment included telephone counseling along with a home telemonitoring scale and instructions to self-weigh daily. Measures. Outcomes included overall program satisfaction and willingness to refer the program to others. Predictors included demographics, treatment group, participation in other programs, expected weight, general health, body mass index, diet quality, physical activity, body image, mental health, counseling, and self-weighing. Analysis. Quantitative predictor-outcome associations were examined using multiple logistic regressions. Qualitative satisfaction responses were analyzed using a general inductive approach. Results. Weight loss (odds ratio [OR] = 1.83, p = .008), improved diet (OR = 1.27, p = .092), increased physical activity (OR = 1.05, p = .034), and improved body image (OR = 1.38, p = .051) were independent predictors of overall satisfaction. Treatment group (OR = 14.83, p = .015) and number of counseling calls (OR = 1.49, p = .009) were predictors of willingness to refer the program. Qualitative themes indicated desire to integrate counseling on emotional issues. Conclusion. Health progress explained overall satisfaction, whereas treatment characteristics explained willingness to endorse the intervention. Concentrating on these factors may improve retention. Limitations included self-reported measures. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study investigated the associations among 100% juice consumption, nutrient intake, and measures of weight in adolescents. Design. A cross-sectional secondary analysis of data from adolescents aged 12 to 18 years (n = 3939) participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 was conducted to assess nutrient and weight in categories of 100% juice consumption. Methods. Least square means and logistic regression analyses were generated, and were adjusted for gender, age, ethnicity, and energy intake. Analyses were Bonferroni corrected with an effective p value of .0125. Results. Twenty-eight percent of adolescents (51 % male, 42% Hispanic, 25% non- Hispanic white, 29% non-Hispanic black) consumed 100% juice the day of the recall. The mean amount of 100% juice consumed was 3. 7 ounces (2.2 % of energy intake). Compared with non—juice consumers, carbohydrate, fiber, vitamins C and B6, folate, potassium, copper, magnesium, and iron intakes ofjuice consumers were higher, and intakes offat and saturated fatty acids were lower. Those consuming greater than 6 ounces ofjuice consumed more servings offruit and less discretionary fat and added sugar than nonconsumers. No differences were found in weight by juice consumption group. Conclusion. In conclusion, when compared with non—juice consumers, adolescents consuming 100% juice did not show mean increased weight measures. Juice provided valuable nutrients, and consumption was associated with lower intakes of total fat, saturated fatty acids, discretionary fat, and added sugars and with higher intakes of whole fruit; however, consumption was not associated with decreased intake of milk, meat, or grains.

AB- Soon to be published research shows that people with positive health practices reduced the period of disability at the end of life by an estimated six to nine years. If improved health habits could reduce the period of disability for the entire population of the United States by this amount, spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security would drop substantially, and state and federal income tax revenues would increase substantially. This is critically important given that the Congressional Budget Office has projected that 100% of federal tax revenues will be consumed by Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security by the year 2050 if current health and spending trends continue.

AB- Purpose. Access and quality of physical activity resources (PARs) influence physical activity (PA) participation. This study examined the type, size, accessibility, features, amenities, and incivilities of PARS in two cities. Design. Researchers identified all PARs within an 800-meter radius of the homes of participants from a larger study. Each PAR was evaluated by a trained assessor. Setting. PARS were evaluated in Houston and Austin, Texas. Patients. The final sample included 1326 PARs in Houston and 297 in Austin, Texas. Measures. The 2010 Physical Activity Resource Assessment (PARA), a direct-observation audit tool, was used to assess the type, size, accessibility, features, amenities, and incivilities of a PAR. Analysis. Both t-tests and analyses of variance were used to determine differences in features, amenities, and incivilities by city, type, and accessibility. Results. Houston PARs had greater amenities (t[421] = 4.445; p < .001) and fewer incivilities (t[3 71] = -6.89; p < .001) than Austin PARs. Combination resources had the highest score for features (M = 9.94; standard deviation [SD] = 5.62); fitness clubs had the highest score for amenities (M = 17.06; SD = 5.27); and trails had the most incivilities (M = 4.23; SD = 4.88). Free PARS had greater features (F[3, 1509] = 16.87; p < .001), amenities (F[3, 1500] 3.13; p = .025), and incivilities (F[3, 1540] = 21.97; p <.001) than pay for use PARs. Conclusion. Improvements to quality and maintenance of existing free PARS may be an economical strategy to increase PA. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

The principles of evaluative thinking include six methods including the problem definition, theory of change, criteria, taking account of stakeholders and context, clarity of policy language and planning for implementation and effect. In complex problems, the concept of evaluative thinking can help in transparency of decision making. The gap between research and its application can be minimized through this concept.

AB- Purpose. To examine the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the effectiveness of a disease management-health promotion intervention among community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities. Design. Secondary data analyses of a randomized controlled trial. Settings. Nineteen counties in upstate New York and on the West Virginia-Ohio border. Subjects. Four hundred fifty-two Medicare beneficiaries who participated in the Medicare Primary and Consumer- Directed Care Demonstration between August 1998 and June 2002 and completed the 22-month follow-up. Intervention. Multicomponent disease management-health promotion intervention involving patient education, individualized health promotion coaching, medication management, and physician care management. Measures. Body mass index and dependence in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Analysis. Multivariate linear regression. Results. The intervention resulted in significantly less worsening in ADLs dependence among normal-weight participants (coefficient, -.42; p = .04). However, the intervention did not have a significant effect for underweight participants (F test p = .33 vs. underweight participants in the control group) or overweight or obese participants (F test p = . 78 vs. overweight or obese participants in the control group). Conclusions. A positive effect of the intervention on disability was found among normal-weight participants but not among underweight or overweight or obese participants. Future health promotion interventions should take into consideration the influence of BMI categories on treatment effects. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Depressed employees are vulnerable to adverse work outcomes. We hypothesized that work performance is impaired by depression and is worsened by exposure to psychosocial work stressors. Design. Longitudinal cohort study with surveys administered at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Setting. Recruitment in primary care offices. Subjects. A total of 14,268 were screened; 286 depressed, employed adults (18-62 years) and 193 controls were enrolled. Measures. At-work limitations (presenteeism) and absenteeism were measured with the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) and WLQ Work Absence Module, respectively. Work stressors were assessed using a modified version of the Job Content Questionnaire. Analysis. Univariate and multivariate tests assessed the degree to which at-work limitations were related to depression and/or stressful work. Results. Presenteeism and absenteeism were significantly worse for the depression group at each time point (p ≤ .001). In cross-sectional models, presenteeism was associated with more severe depression symptoms, poorer general physical health, psychologically demanding work, the interaction of psychologically demanding work with depression, and less job control (r² range = .33-.54). Absences were explained by depression symptom severity and poorer general physical health but not work stressors (r² = .19). Because of minimal change in the work stressors, their longitudinal effects on outcomes were mostly nonsignificant. Conclusion. This study found that depression symptoms are related to work absences and impaired work performance, and results partly confirmed that work stressors add to this impact. Results suggest that workers with depression may benefit from care involving medical and vocational interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the association between the levels of participation in an incentive-based health promotion program (Vitality) and inpatient medical claims among members of a major health insurer. Design. A 1-year, cross-sectional, correlational analyses of engagement with a health promotion program and hospital claims experience (admissions costs, days in hospital, and admission rate) of members of a national private health insurer. Setting. Adult members of South Africa's largest national private health insurer, Discovery Health. Insured members were also eligible for voluntary membership in an insurance-linked incentivized health promotion program, Vitality. Subjects. The study sample included 948,974 adult members of the Discovery Health plan for the year 2006. Of these, 591,134 (62.3%) were also members of the Vitality health promotion program. Measures. The study sample was grouped based on registration and the level of engagement with the Vitality health promotion program into the following: not registered (37.5%), registered but not engaged with any health promotion activity (21.9%), low engagement (30.9%), and high engagement (9.5%). High engagement was defined a priori by the accumulation of an arbitrary number of points on the Vitality program, allocated against specific activities (knowledge, fitness-related activities, assessment and screening, and healthy choices). Hospital admission costs; the number of days in hospital, and hospital admission rates were compared among highly engaged members and these members who some not enrolled in the program, nonengaged, and lowly engaged. Data were normalized for age, gender, plan type, and chronic disease status. Results. Highly engaged members had lower costs per patient, shorter stays in hospital, and fewer admissions compared with other groups (p < .001). Low or no engagement was not associated with lower hospital outs. Admission rates were also 7.4% lower for cardiovascular disease, 13.2% lower for cancers, and 20. 7% lower for endocrine and metabolic diseases in the highly engaged group compared with any of the other groups (p < .01). Conclusions. Engagement in an incentive-based wellness program, offered by a health insure, was associated wit/s lower health care costs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. We describe the perceived usefulness of a learning collaborative for translating obesity prevention science into practice at YMCA after-school programs. Approach. We conducted mixed-methods research to identify beneficial aspects of the collaborative and to assess perceived effect of the collaborative on ability to meet goals. Setting. Sixty-one YMCA after-school programs serving roughly 2500 children in 21 states. Participants. After-school program staff attending learning sessions for the collaborative. Intervention. YMCA learning collaboratives comprise a structured organizational change process delivered during 9 to 12 months that aim to empower staff to find local methods for achieving specific program outcomes related to diet and physical activity. Research Method. Eight focus groups conducted during the collaboratives assessed their usefulness. A post hoc Web-based follow-up survey (39 respondents; response rate, 40.6%) assessed final perceived effect. Results. Qualitative and quantitative data were highly positive about the usefulness of the collaborative. The collaboratives' duration, peer learning, multilevel staff involvement, focus on creating a supportive organization, and regular coaching support enabled many respondents to make program and policy changes consistent with project goals. There was consensus that executive-level commitment to the work was critical. Conclusion. Learning collaboratives are a promising tool for embedding health promotion practices in existing after-school programs through a structured organizational change process. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To test whether implementing a staff wellness program affects the nutrition and physical activity environment at child care centers. Design. Quasi-experimental controlled trial. Setting. Child care centers in low income neighborhoods in California. Subjects. Eighty-two staff members at 13 centers completed the study. Intervention. Intervention and control groups received training and education about nutrition and physical activity. The intervention group also participated in a worksite wellness program. Measures. Staff members' personal health habits, self-efficacy in working with families on nutrition and physical activity, and changes in children's food and physical activity environments were assessed. Analysis. Statistical software was used to analyze change scores for pre-post measures and to test differences for end point-only measures. Results. Although significant differences in staff members' personal health behaviors were not observed, staff from intervention sites exhibited more positive changes in their comfort level in talking to parents about nutrition and physical activity. Intervention sites reported providing more fresh fruits (p = .004) and vegetables (p = .03) to children as part of regular meals and snacks and serving more fresh fruits (p = .05) at children's celebrations. Control sites reported greater increases in sweetened foods (p = .02) and sweetened beverages (p = .05) at children's celebrations. Conclusion. The wellness intervention shows promise in improving the children's food environment in a child care setting. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Assess whether family environmental factors affected changes in fruit and snack consumption among 12- to 14-year-old adolescents participating in a Dutch healthy diet promotion program. Design. Data were derived from pretest and posttest questionnaires completed by adolescents in 10 schools in the intervention arm of the program trial and questionnaires completed by their parents during program implementation. Setting. Lower vocational schools in the southern and central parts of The Netherlands. Subjects. Questionnaire answers of 502 parents were matched with those of their children. Intervention. Eight school lessons using various theory-based materials and strategies. Measures. Dietary intake, ethnicity, education level, employment status, parenting style, food purchase considerations, family food rules, and food availability and accessibility at home. Analysis. Regression analyses. Results. No significant family environmental predictors of program-induced changes in either fruit or snack intake were found. Conclusion. A limitation of the study was that all data were self-reported. No evidence was found that there were subgroups of adolescents who profited less from the program because of family environmental factors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Exploratory factor analysis is used to identify latent factors for public health interventions. The most popular factor retention criterion, the eigenvalue greater than one (EVG1) rule, leads to the retention of more factors than warranted. The use of parallel analysis (PA) as a factor retention criterion is recommended. Design. Environmental factors that are likely to affect the propensity of individuals to walk are identified. Results from PA are compared with those obtained by using the EVG1 rule. Setting. Telephone survey data were collected from three communities (spanning 12 counties) in the Appalachian region. Participants. The sample was composed of adults between the ages of 40 and 65 years. There were 1019 completed surveys. Measures. The data on 14 variables, including measures of neighborhood safety, beauty, and access to walking facilities were collected. Analysis. A principal components analysis was performed. The factors retained after using the EVG1 rule were compared with the factors retained after using PA. Varimax rotation was used to aid factor interpretation. Results. The EVG1 rule led to the retention of nearly twice the number of latent factors as did the PA criterion. conclusion. The use of the EVG1 rule in research may mislead policy makers to focus on trivial interventions. They are urged to use PA to obtain more parsimonious and externally valid interventions.

AB- Purpose. Sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates have continued to increase among men who have sex with men (MSM). The present study used qualitative methods to assess sources of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/STD information and responses to HIV/STD prevention messages among MSM. This was done to understand how to design more effective media campaigns on HIV/STD prevention and testing for this population. Design. One-on-one semistructured, qualitative interviews and a brief demographic written survey were conducted. Setting. A Massachusetts community-based organization specializing in HIV/AIDS healthcare. Participants. A novel, modified, respondent-driven sampling method was used to recruit a diverse sample of 50 Massachusetts MSM between January and April 2005; qualitative interviews were conducted until redundancy in responses was achieved. Method. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. NVIVO software was used to organize transcripts, identify themes, and report frequency of responses. Results. Respondents reported having derived information on sexual health from multiple media sources. Direct outreach, gay- and HIV-centered organizations, print and broadcast media, public transportation ads, and the Internet held the greatest potential for dissemination. Primary care providers were also frequently seen as trusted sources of HIV/ STD prevention information. Ideas for content often included having "people just like you" in ads. Conclusion. Health messages that focus on getting tested for HIV and STDs, practicing safe sex, and incorporating straightforward and accurate information on prevention may be the most acceptable to MSM. Providers should be proactive in disseminating information about HIV/STD prevention. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine whether certain patterns of objectively measured physical activity (PA) are associated with the risk factors for or the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome (MS). Design. Latent class analysis, including assessment of the associations between latent PA classes and risk factors for the MS. Setting. Random sample from throughout the United States using data from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Subjects. A total of 3458 civilian adult noninstitutionalized U.S. citizens. Measures. Daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA across a 7-day week based on accelerometer measurements, as well as high blood pressure, blood glucose levels, triglyceride levels, and body mass index, along with low levels of high density lipoproteins, using clinical cut points. Results. Membership in the more active PA classes was consistently associated with lower odds of all risk factors for the MS. However, when participants were categorized into quartiles of the coefficients of variation of PA across 7 days, few differences were seen in any of the risk factors. Conclusions. Accumulating the total weekly recommended amount of PA is consistently associated with positive health profiles, and more PA than the recommended amounts may be even better. However, the manner in which this activity is accumulated, either spread over most days of the week or compressed into just a couple of days, may have similar associations with the risk factors for the MS.

AB- Purpose. To examine associations of the built environment surrounding worksites and of work policies with walking behaviors. Design. Cross-sectional convenience sample survey. Setting. Workplace. Subjects. Employed adults residing in Montgomery County, Maryland. Measures. Four different step measures taken at or near work as recorded using an accelerometer and a fifth measure indicated self-reported walking from work. Participants reported on eight built environment characteristics surrounding the worksite (e.g., the presence of sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals) and on four worksite policies (e.g., the presence of exercise facilities and exercise programs). Analysis. Cross-sectional associations of self-reported built environment characteristics surrounding worksites and worksite policies with walking behavior were examined. Results. Although participants reported worksites exhibiting built environment characteristics that were supportive of walking (seven of eight characteristics were reported by >50% of participants), no built environment characteristic was associated with walking more than the median number of average weekday steps (p ≥ .05). All four worksite policies were associated with walking more than the median number of average weekday steps (p < .05). In addition, a perception of few cul-de-sacs and of the presence of litter, sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals surrounding the worksites was associated with a higher proportion of participants taking at least one walking trip from work in the past month (p < .05). Conclusions. Locating worksites in walkable environments and implementing worksite policies may favorably influence employee walking. Future studies should consider a prospective design and examine a larger, more diverse employee population and worksite environment to examine these associations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Consumer understanding of nutrition information is key to making dietary choices consistent with guidelines. The development of an objective, science-based, and univ. sally applicable system of nutrition guidance would he of considerable Potential value to the public health. Design. A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop the Overall Nutritional Quality Index (ONQI). Dietary guidelines, existing nutritional scoring systems, and other pertinent scientific literature were reviewed. An algorithm based on the overall nutritional quality of food was developed and subjected to consumer research and validation testing. Results. The ONQI algorithm incorporates over 30 entries representing both micronutrient and macronutrient properties of foods, as well as weighting coefficients representing epidemiologic associations between nutrients and health outcomes. The basic entry in the algorithm is a weighted trajectory score, which compares nutrient concentration in a food to the recommended concentration of a given nutrient in a healthful diet. In content validity testing, ONQI rankings and expert panel rankings correlated highly (R = .92; p < .001). In regression analysis, aggregated ONQI scores for total diet corresponded well with the Healthy Eating Index (p < .001) in the National Health and Nutrient Examination Survey 2003-2006 cohort (n = 15,900). Consumer research indicated strong appeal to consumers of the ONQI system in general, and the scores on a 1 to 100 scale specifically. A system for acquiring nutrient data, meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture standards, has been established so that virtually any food, beverage, meal, or recipe can be scored. Conclusions. The ONQI is a sophisticated nutrition guidance system developed by a multidisciplinary group independently of all food industry interests with excellent initial performance in both consumer research and validation testing. Combined with a consumer education program, the ONQI has considerable potential to improve dietary pattewis, and consequently the public health. Prospective. Study of effects on dietary patterns and health outcomes is warranted. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To gather consumer input about approaches to providing energy composition information for foods on fast-food restaurant menus. Design. We asked a subset of individuals (n = 150) in an experimental study about the influence of nutrition labeling on fast-food meal choices to evaluate calorie information on mock fast-food menus in various formats. Setting. Three community sites in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area. Subjects. Adolescents and adults who ate fast food at least once per week were recruited. Measures. Via a series of open- and close-ended questions, participants gave feedback about several formats fur providing energy composition information for foods on fast-food restaurant menus. Analysis. Means and frequencies were calculated, and χ² tests were conducted. Results. When asked to compare a menu that provided calorie information for each menu item with a menu that provided the number of minutes of running that would be required to burn the calories contained in each menu item, 71.0% of participants preferred the calorie information over the physical activity information. Participants also compared two approaches to providing caloric reference information on the menu (average daily calorie needs per day vs. per meal), and 61.3% preferred the calorie needs-per-meal format. conclusion. Our results may be useful in designing approaches to providing energy composition information for foods on fast-food restaurant menus. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To test effects of parent/child training designed to increase calcium intake, bone-loading physical activity (PA), and bone density. Design. Two-group randomized controlled trial. Setting. Family-based intervention delivered at research center. Subjects. 117 healthy children aged 10-13 years (58.1% female, 42.7% Hispanic, 40.2% White). Ninety-seven percent of participants had at least one parent graduate from high school and 37.2% had at least one parent graduate from a 4-year university. Intervention. Children and parents were randomly assigned to diet and exercise (experimental) or injury prevention (control) interventions. Children were taught in right weekly classes how to engage in hone-loading PA and eat calcium-rich foods or avoid injuries. Parents were taught behavior management techniques to modify children's behaviors. Measures. Measures at baseline and at 3, 9, and 12 months included 24-hour diet and PA recalls, and bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Analysis. Analysis of variance and generalized estimating equations (GEE) assessed group by time differences. Comparisons were conducted separately for boys and girls. Results. For boys, cross-sectional differences between experimental and control groups were achieved for 3- and 9-month calcium intake (1352 vs. 1052 mg/day, 1298 vs. 970 mg/day, p < .05). For girls, marginal cross-sectional differences were achieved for high-impact PA at 12 months (p < .10). For calcium intake, a significant group by time interaction was observed from pretest to posttest for the full sample (p = .008) and for girls (p = .006) but not for boys. No significant group by time differences in calcium were observed across the follow-up period. No group by time differences were observed for high-impact PA. Among boys; longitudinal group by time differences reached significance for total hip BMD (p .045) and femoral neck BMD (p = .033), even after adjusting for skeletal growth. Similar differential increases were observed among boys for bone mineral content (BMC) at the hip (p = .068) and total body (p = .054) regions. No significant group by time interaction effects were observed for girls at any bone site for BMD. For BMC, control girls showed a significant increase (p = .03) in spine BMC compared to intervention girls. Conclusion. This study demonstrated that parent/preteen training can increase calcium intake and attenuate the decline in high-impact PA. Results suggest that more powerful interventions are needed to increase activity levels and maximize bone mineral accrual during preadolescent years. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. Evaluate the effectiveness of distance physical activity interventions to establish intervention features that are key to success. Data Source. Computerized searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of distance physical activity interventions and visual scans of reference lists were performed between March 2004 and July 2006. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Studies were included if they (1) employed a randomized controlled design, (2) encouraged physical activity in adults, and (3) had no face-to-face contact between participants and researchers or health educators. Data Extraction. Twenty-two studies were found that met the inclusion criteria. Authors assessed the quality of the studies and coded articles according to key intervention features. Data Synthesis. This review is a systematic narrative review. Heterogeneity and poor study quality made formal meta-analysis inappropriate. Nevertheless, effect sizes were calculated for studies comparing intervention with control. Results. Overall, distance interventions increased physical activity in the short term (between-group effect size range, - .2 to .45). Print medium plus telephone contact was the most effective delivery mode. Conclusions. Poor study quality prevented firm conclusions. However, distance interventions were found to promote physical activity in the short term for some populations. This review provided limited support for the efficacy of distance exercise interventions and revealed limitations of the extant literature. Expansion of RCT research into distance approaches to promoting physical activity is warranted. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Policies that address the food environment at the population level may help prevent chronic disease, but their value to society is still uncertain. Dietary sodium is linked to increased prevalence of hypertension, a primary risk fact or for cardiovascular and renal diseases. This study calculates the potential societal savings of reducing hypertension and related cardiovascular disease via a reduction in population-level sodium intake. On average, U.S. adults consume almost twice the recommended maximum of dietary sodium, most of it from processed foods. Design. This study modeled sodium-reduction scenarios by using a cross-sectional simulation approach. The model used population-level data on blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, and sodium intake from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2004). This data was then combined with parameters from the literature on sodium effects, disease outcomes, costs, and quality of life to yield model outcomes. Measures. This study calculated the following outcome measures: hypertension prevalence, direct health care costs, and quality-adjusted life years for noninstitutionalized U.S. adults. Analysis. The simulation was conducted with STATA 9.2 and Microsoft Excel. Survey weights were used to calculate population averages. Results. Reducing average population sodium intake to 2300 mg per day, the recommended maximum for adults, may reduce cases of hypertension by 11 million, save $18 billion health care dollars, and gain 312,000 QALYs that are worth $32 billion annually. Greater reductions in population sodium consumption bring even greater savings to society. conclusions. Large benefits to society may result from efforts to lower sodium consumption on a population level by modest amounts over time. Although savings in direct health care costs are likely to be quite high, they could easily be matched or exceeded by the value of quality-of-life improvements. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Assess the association of taking incidental sickness absence with health risks and health status. Design. Observational. Setting. One Midwest health care system. Subjects. Individuals who were employed for 2 years (2006-2007) and had completed at least one health risk appraisal (HRA) in 2007 (N = 3790). Measures. Outcomes were any incidental sickness absence and absence duration in 2007 measured by an absence tracking system. Health risks and health status were estimated by HRAs. Program participation was captured using 7-year HRA data and 5-year wellness data. Analysis. Multivariate, binary logistic regression for the probability of taking any absence day among the overall population as well as four demographic subgroups; proportional odds model for the probability of taking more absence days. Results. Different patterns were observed in association with taking incidental sickness absence among age and gender subgroups. Among the overall population, three health risks (smoking, overweight, and use of medication for relaxation) were positively associated with taking absence (at least p < .05 for all three health risks). Participation in a wellness program for more years was also associated with a less likelihood of taking absence (odds ratio, . 72; p = .002). Results from the proportional odds model were consistent with results from the binary logistic regression. conclusion. Sickness absence is an important productivity concern of employers. Employers may implement early interventions to focus on preventable causes. Special interventions may target absence-causing risks such as smoking behavior and excess body weight. Study limitation includes a lack of measures for psychosocial work environment. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Determine the relationships between cycling and urban sprawl and between cycling and the gasoline price. Analysis. Cross-sectional multivariate regression analyses using pooled data from two individual-level national surveys to analyze the effects of variations in levels of urban sprawl and the gasoline price on cycling as a form of physical activity. Setting. Metropolitan areas representative of the U.S. population, 1990 to 2001. Subjects. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System: 146, 730 individuals at least 18 years old in the United States; Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey: 73,903 individuals at least 18 years old in the United States. Measures. Self-reported information on bicycling served as the dependent variable. Urban sprawl and the gasoline price served as key independent variables. Results. Living in a metropolitan area with a lower degree of urban sprawl increased the probability of cycling in the past month by 3.4 to 4.4 percentage points and 1.6 to 2.1 percentage points from the means for men and women, respectively. Increasing the gasoline price by one dollar increased the probability of cycling by 4.3 to 4.7 percentage points and 2.9 to 3.5 percentage points for men and women, respectively. Conclusion. Results indicate that the prevalence of cycling is higher in less sprawling areas and areas with higher gasoline prices. More research is needed to refine results on how individuals respond to incentives and the roles that monetary and time costs play in improving public health. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Compare the efficacy of two interventions designed to promote health and physical activity (PA). Design. This study was a randomized clinical trial using a time series design. Subjects were randomized into individualized physical rehabilitation (IPR) and group wellness intervention (GWI). Primary questionnaires were administered twice preintervention and twice postintervention. Physical fitness and PA frequency were assessed preintervention and postintervention. Setting. Clinic based in a metropolitan area. Subjects. Fifty volunteers with multiple sclerosis. Interventions. IPR consisted of four physical therapy sessions plus three telephone calls. GWI consisted of seven educational sessions. Measures. Primary: SF-36 Health Survey, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Mental Health Inventory. Secondary: physical assessment, PA frequency. Analysis. Stability of primary questionnaires between the two pretests was examined. Efficacy of interventions was evaluated by multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and effect sizes. Results. Primary measures were stable between pretests. MANOVA showed nonsignificant differences between interventions. Eight weeks postintervention, both groups had improved PA, fatigue, resting heart rate, and strength. Effect sizes suggested that IPR had a greater effect on preventing decline of physical health, whereas GWI had a greater effect on improving mental health. Conclusion. Preliminary evidence indicated that health and PA improved in both groups. Effect sizes suggested that participants benefited more physically from IPR and more mentally from GWI. Future research should determine whether combining therapeutic exercise with group education improves both mental and physical health. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study examined how to improve dietary habits of individuals from the general public. Design. The Eating for a Healthy Life project was a randomized trial. Setting. The study was conducted among members of religious organizations (ROs). Subjects. Participants were a sample of RO members. Intervention. The intervention was a multilevel package, based on our previous experience, designed to lower fat and increase fruit and vegetable consumption. Measures. The Eating Behaviors Questionnaire was administered preintervention and postintervention, together with 24-hour food recalls in a randomly selected subset. Analysis. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the study's intervention, incorporating the design effects of blocking, intraclass correlation within RO, and correlation between the preintervention and postintervention points. Results. Participants (n = 2175) reported significantly healthier dietary behaviors in intervention ROs at the 12-month follow-up period, compared to participants in the comparison ROs, for a fat scale change of .08 summary scale points and an adjusted intervention effect of .06 overall. Conclusion. Dietary intervention through ROs is a positive and successful method of changing dietary habits. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To identify different segments of U.S. consumers based on food choices, exercise patterns, and desire for restaurant calorie labeling. Design. Using a stratified (by region) random sample of the U.S. population, trained interviewers collected data for this cross-sectional study through telephone surveys. Setting. Center for Rural Studies U.S. national health survey. Subjects. The final sample included 580 responses (22% response rate); data were weighted to be representative of age and gender characteristics of the U.S. population. Measures. Self-reported behaviors related to food choices, exercise patterns, desire for calorie information in restaurants, and sample demographics. Analysis. Clusters were identified using Schwartz Bayesian criteria. Impacts of demographic characteristics on cluster membership were analyzed using bivariate tests of association and multinomial logit regression. Results. Cluster analysis revealed three clusters based on respondents' food choices, activity levels, and desire for restaurant labeling. Two clusters, comprising three quarters of the sample, desired calorie labeling in restaurants. The remaining cluster opposed restaurant labeling. Demographic variables significantly predicting cluster membership included region of residence (p < .10), income (p < .05), gender (p < .01), and age (p < .10). Conclusions. Though limited by a low response and potential self-reporting bias in the phone survey, this study suggests that several groups are likely to benefit from restaurant calorie labeling. Specific demographic clusters could be targeted through labeling initiatives. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Investigate the relationship between alcohol consumption and physical activity because understanding whether there are common determinants of health behaviors is critical in designing programs to change risky activities. Design. Cross-sectional analysis. Setting. United States. Subjects. A sample of adults representative of the U.S. population (N = 230,856) from the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Measures. Several measures of drinking and exercise were analyzed. Specifications included numerous health, health behavior, socioeconomic, and demographic control variables. Results. For women, current drinkers exercise 7.2 more minutes per week than abstainers. Ten extra drinks per month are associated with 2.2 extra minutes per week of physical activity. When compared with current abstainers, light, moderate, and heavy drinkers exercise 5.7, 10.1, and 19.9 more minutes per week. Drinking is associated with a 10.1 percentage point increase in the probability of exercising vigorously. Ten extra drinks per month are associated with a 2.0 percentage point increase in the probability of engaging in vigorous physical activity. Light, moderate, and heavy drinking are associated with 9.0, 14.3, and 13. 7 percentage point increases in the probability of exercising vigorously. The estimation results for men are similar to those for women. Conclusions. Our results strongly suggest that alcohol consumption and physical activity are positively correlated. The association persists at heavy drinking levels. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. To identify characteristics of effective interventions designed to increase physical activity (PA) or fitness among African-Americans. Data Sources. Articles published between 1985 and 2006. Study Inclusion Criteria. Studies reporting PA or fitness change data in African-American participants were included. Data Extraction. Information on study design, intervention, data collection methods, and outcomes was extracted using a standardized form. Data Synthesis. Studies were ranked on quality and were summarized separately for adults and children. Results. We identified 29 studies in adults and 14 studies in children. Most were randomized controlled trials. All but six specifically targeted African-Americans; comparisons of effectiveness in African-Americans vs. others were not possible. Methodological heterogeneity limited comparisons of findings across studies. In adults, most studies showed significant within-group pre-post improvements in PA, but only 10 studies found differences between intervention and comparison groups. Most studies in children were null. Conclusious. Effective programs in adults were from randomized controlled trials and involved structured exercise programs. Studies with explicit cultural adaptations did not necessarily result in better PA outcomes. Additional studies are needed with larger sample sizes, longer follow-up, attention controls, strategies informed by proven behavior change theories; and objective PA assessment.

AB- Objective. To describe physical activity (PA) interventions implemented in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN,) populations in the United Slates and Canada. Data Sources. MEDLINE, PubMed, ERIC, and Sociological Abstracts were used to identify peer-reviewed journal articles. Dissertation abstracts, Web sites, and conference proceedings were searched to identify descriptions within the gray literature from 1986 to 2006. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. The target population had to be described as AI/AN, aboriginal native Hawaiian, and/or native U.S. Samoan. PA interventions among indigenous populations of Latin America were not included. Data Extraction. Descriptions of 64 different AI/AN PA interventions (28 peer-reviewed journal articles and 36 in the gray literature) were identified. Data Synthesis. Data were synthesized by geographic region, intervention strategy, target audience, activities; and sustainability. Results. Most interventions were conducted in the southwest United States (35.4%), in reservation communities (72%), and among participants 18 years and younger (57.8%). Forty-one percent of the 27 interventions with evaluation components reported significant change in health, behavior, or knowledge. Conclusions. Effective AI/AN PA interventions demonstrated impact on individual health and community resources. Program sustainability was linked to locally trained personnel local leadership, and stable funding. Culturally acceptable and scientifically sound evaluation methods that can be implemented by local personnel are needed to assess the health and social impact of many long-running AI/AN PA interventions.

AB- Purpose. To model the potential long-term national productivity benefits from reduced daily intake of calories and sodium. Design. Simulation based on secondary data analysis; quantitative research. Measures include absenteeism, presenteeism, disability, and premature mortality under various hypothetical dietary changes. Setting. United States. Subjects. Two hundred twenty-five million adults. Measures. Findings come from a Nutrition Impact Model that combines information from national surveys, peer-reviewed studies, and government reports. Analysis. We compare current estimates of national productivity loss associated with overweight, obesity, and hypertension to estimates for hypothetical scenarios in which national prevalence of these risk factors is lower. Using the simulation model, we illustrate how modest dietary change can achieve lower national prevalence of excess weight and hypertension. Results. We estimate that permanent 100-kcal reductions in daily intake among time overweight/obese would eliminate approximately 71.2 million cases of overweight/obesity. In the long term, this could increase national productivity by $45.7 billion annually. Long-term sodium reductions of 400 mg in those with uncontrolled hypertension would eliminate about 1.5 million cases, potentially increasing productivity by $2.5 billion annually. More aggressive diet changes of 500 kcal and 1100 mg of sodium reductions yield potential productivity benefits of $133.3 and $5.8 billion, respectively. Conclusions. The potential long-term benefit of reduced calories and sodium, combining medical cost savings with, productivity increases, ranges from $108.5 billion for moderate reductions to $255.6 billion for aggressive reductions. These findings help inform public health policy and the business case for improving diet. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Model the potential national health benefits and medical savings from reduced daily intake of calories, sodium, and saturated fat among the U S. adult population. Design. Simulation based on secondary data analysis; quantitative research. Measures include the prevalence of overweight/obesity, uncontrolled hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and related chronic conditions under various hypothetical dietary changes. Setting. United States. Subjects. Two hundred twenty-four million adults. Measures. Findings come from a Nutrition Impact Model that combines information from national surveys, peer-reviewed studies, and government reports. Analysis. The simulation model predicts disease prevalence and medical expenditures under hypothetical dietary change scenarios. Results. We estimate that permanent 100-kcal reductions in daily intake would eliminate approximately 71.2 million cases of overweight/obesity and save $58 billion annually. Long-term sodium intake reductions of 400 mg/d in those with uncontrolled hypertension would eliminate about 1.5 million cases, saving $2.3 billion annually. Decreasing 5 g/d of saturated fat intake in those with elevated cholesterol would eliminate 3. 9 million cases, saving $2.0 billion annually. Conclusions. Modest to aggressive changes in diet can improve health and reduce annual national medical expenditures by $60 billion to $120 billion. One use of the model is to estimate the impact of dietary change related to setting public health priorities for dietary guidance. The findings here argue that emphasis on reduction in caloric intake should be the highest priority. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Smarter than Smoking is a multistrategy statewide youth smoking intervention. This article describes key strategies and results from its inception in 1995 to 2005. Design. Comprehensive evaluation included formative research and baseline and follow-up surveys. Triennial national surveys provided independent monitoring of adolescent smoking prevalence. Setting. Western Australia. Subjects. 10- to 15-year-olds. Intervention. A multipronged strategy mix, including mass media, the Internet, sponsorship, school initiatives, publications, and advocavy. Measures. Smoking prevalence, media awareness, and attitudes toward smoking and campaign messages. Analysis. Trend comparisons across the first decade of the project, along with descriptive statistics. Results. Significant attitudinal and behavioral shifts were observed following media waves and over time. There was a steady increase in the proportion who had never smoked (from 40% in 1996 to 61 % in 2005). Results also showed a significant decrease in smoking prevalence from 1996 to 2005, down from 28% to 7% among 14-year-olds and from 43% to 14% among 15-year-olds. Conclusions. Smarter than Smoking was effective in achieving positive shifts in awareness, attitudes, intentions, and behavior. Effectiveness appeared to have been enhanced fry sustained long-term funding youth involvement in strategy development, and a strong research and evaluation base. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. There is a dearth of information about factors related to physical activity among Mexican-Americans with diabetes. Self-efficacy and social support are associated with physical activity; however, little is known about their roles within different cultural groups. Design. Focus groups were used to identify factors that motivated walking. Setting. Two Mexican-American communities located in Tucson, Arizona. Subjects. Individuals who attended diabetes education. Intervention. A community-based provider organized walking groups with people who previously attended diabetes classes. Walkers participated in focus groups exploring themes related to their experiences. Measures. Self-efficacy, social support, and collective efficacy. Grounded theory was used to analyze focus group results using two rounds of analysis; the first identified references to self-efficacy and social support, and the second added collective efficacy as a theoretic basis for walking. Results. Among 43 eligible participants, 20 participated in focus groups. Social support was expressed as commitment and companionship. Walkers demonstrated a high level of self-efficacy for walking. Development of group identity/social cohesion was also a motivator to walk. Collective efficacy emerged as an applicable theoretic model encompassing these themes and their interrelationship. Conclusion. Collective efficacy, or the belief that the group can improve their lives through collective effort, is a viable theoretic construct in the development of physical activity interventions targeting Mexican-Americans with diabetes.

AB- Purpose. Assessment of self-reported physical activity (PA) and effects on health measures. Design. Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a cohort study. Setting. Education and Research Towards Health study participants from Alaska and the Southwestern United States enrolled from 2004 to 2007. Subjects. Total of 10,372 American Indian and Alaskan Native people (AI/AN) of at least 18 years. Measures. Participants completed computer-assisted, self-administered questionnaires, and anthropometric and health measurements were taken of each participant. Analysis. Analysis of variance, X² tests, and multiple linear regressions were used. Results. Almost 23% of participants reported less than 30 minutes per week of moderate or vigorous activities. Half (49%) reported no vigorous activities. Characteristics associated with more time spent performing vigorous activity were male gender, age less than 40 years, higher income and education levels, and living in a rural area. Almost 70% of Alaskan participants and 36% of Southwest participants engaged in wild food-harvesting activities. Participants with higher levels of activity had significantly better clinical characteristics (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index, and waist circumference). Conclusion. AI/AN people engage in many different physical activities, including traditional harvesting activities. Women had lower levels of PA than men, and participation in vigorous PA was associated with better clinical characteristics. These data can be used to guide health promotion efforts in AI/AN populations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Identify if outreach support increases school-aged children's participation in recreational activities. Design. Cluster randomized trial. Setting. Sixteen schools in economically vulnerable neighborhoods were randomized to either an intervention or control group. Subjects. Children in grades 3 to 5 and their families were invited to participate. Intervention. Children in intervention schools were assigned a "connector" (outreach worker) to facilitate participation in recreation activities. Measures. The Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE) was the primary measure at baseline, middle, and end of 1 year. Demographics, body mass index, child physical and psychosocial health, coordination, and self-esteem were measured. Analysis. A generalized linear model was used to test differences between intervention and control groups. Results. Three hundred and sixty children enrolled, and 306 (85%) completed the study. A greater proportion of children in the intervention group compared with the control group increased participation in physical activity (21 % vs. 10%, p = .02). Children who increased their activity were more likely to have higher levels of contact with the connectors (31 % vs. 8%, p = .001). Study limitations included (1) 29% of eligible families participated, (2) first use of the CAPE instrument as a longitudinal measure, and (3) connectors were not blinded to group assignment. Conclusion. Children living in vulnerable neighborhoods benefit from outreach workers to connect them with physical activity programs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Synopsis Communicating in lay language is an underdeveloped skill among many researchers—a limitation that contributes to low readability among research consent forms and may hinder participant understanding of study procedures and risks. We present the Project to Review and Improve Study Materials (PRISM) and its centerpiece, the PRISM Readability Toolkit. The toolkit provides strategies for creating study materials that are readable and participant centered, focusing on consent forms but also addressing other participant materials. Based on plain language principles, this free resource includes a flexible menu of tools, such as an editing checklist, before and after examples, easy-to-read template language, and a list of alternative words. Among PRISM'S ongoing goals is to lest the toolkit with populations groups. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Evaluate work absence, work productivity, and disruption of work, social, and family life among individuals of varying body mass index (BMI) with or at risk for diabetes mellitus. Design. Cross-sectional analysis of survey data Setting. Community-based U.S. population. Subjects. Respondents (n = 15,132; n = 7338 working adults) participating in the U.S. Study to Help Improve Early evaluation and management of risk factors Leading to Diabetes (SHIELD) study were stratified by combinations of BMI (i.e., ≥ 30 kg/m² [obese], 25 to 29.9 kg/m² [overweight], and <25 kg/m² [normal weight]) and diabetes (i.e., type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM], type 1 diabetes mellitus [T1DM], and high risk [HR] or low risk [LR] of T2DM). Measures. Work impairment was measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire. General Health. Disruption in life was measured using the Sheehan Disability Scale. HR was defined as 3 to 5 of the following factors. abdominal obesity, BMI ≥ 28 kg/m², reported diagnosis of "cholesterol problems," reported diagnosis of "hypertension," or history of coronary heart disease or stroke. LR was defined as ≤ 2 of these factors. Results. Percentage of work impairment and proportion with severe disruption of work, family, and social life increased systematically from normal weight to obese (p < .001). Obese individuals had the greatest impairment at work (11%-15% of work time), greatest impairment of daily activities (20%-34% of time), and greatest overall impairment (11%-15% of time) in the LR, HR, and T2DM groups. Obesity and T2DM were independent predictors of overall work impairment and life disruption (p < .001). Between 5% and 7% of total variance was explained in the regression models with BMI category, diabetes/risk group, age, gender, race, income, and household size as variables. Conclusion. Greatest impairment of work and daily activities was evident among obese individuals for all groups. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine the impact of financial incentives, communications strategy, and worksite culture on health risk assessment (HRA) participation rates. Design. A cross-sectional study design was used to examine factors that influence employee participation, including incentive value, incentive design, communications strategy, and worksite culture. Setting. Large private-sector and public-sector employers. Participants. Thirty-six employers (n = 559,988 employees) that provided financial incentives to promote employee HRA participation. Intervention. Organizations implemented the HRA as part of a more comprehensive worksite health promotion strategy that included follow-up interventions and a variety of other components. The primary outcome of interest was employee HRA participation. Measures. Information on program design and structure, as well as on HRA eligibility and participation, was collected for each organization via standard client report and semi-structured interviews with account managers. General linear regression models were used to examine the extent to which factors influence HRA participation independently and when controlled for other factors. Results. Incentive value (r² = .433; p < .000), benefits-integrated incentive design (r² = .184; p = .009), culture (r² = .113; p = .045), and communications strategy (r² = .300; p = .001) had positive bivariate associations with HRA participation rates. When all factors were included in the model, incentive value (p = .001) and communications strategy (p = .023) were significantly associated with HRA participation. Variance accounted for by all factors combined was R² = .584. Conclusion. This study suggests that incentive value, incentive type, supportive worksite culture, and comprehensive communications strategy may all play a role in increasing HRA participation.

AB- Purpose. Examine the relationship among risk perceptions, health behaviors, and a measure for actual risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Design. Cross-sectional survey. Setting/Subjects. Adults from three outpatient medical clinics with at least one CHD risk factor. Measures. Perceived risk using the new Coronary Risk, Individual Perception (CRIP) scale, an index of CHD risk, and summary scores for self-reported diet and exercise. Analysis. Bivariate associations using Spearman rank and Kruskal-Wallis; multiple regression models for outcomes (health behaviors). Results. The 16-item CRIP scale had acceptable internal consistency (α = 0.76; interitem total correlation = 0.34 ± 0.17). The response rate was 80.3%, and the mean age of 256 respondents was 56.6 (± 9.9) years; 70% were women, 63% Hispanic, and 27% black. CRIP scores were inversely associated with low fat/high fiber intake (r = -0.17; p = .007) and exercise (r = -0.19; p = .003). Among respondents with three or more CHD risk factors (n = 132), 44% perceived themselves to be at low risk for CHD. In multivariable models, men with high CRIP scores had higher fat intake than women (p = .02), but men exercised more (p = .04). Conclusions. In this study, gender moderated the relationship between risk perception and health behaviors, and many respondents underestimated their risk of CHD. Behavioral intervention research aimed at reducing cardiometabolic risk in minority populations should resolve differences between perceived and actual risk of CHD to foster lifestyle changes and examine temporal relationships between risk perception and health behaviors.

AB- Purpose. Outcomes from a statewide program that delivered evidence-based, intensive treatment for tobacco dependence to a rural population of lower socioeconomic status (SES) were evaluated. Factors that predicted success and measurement considerations were examined. Design and Analyses. Data were collected at intake, at all treatment sessions, and at 3- and 12-months posttreatment. Abstinence rates were calculated using complete-case analysis and intention-to-treat analysis, and they were estimated for all participants. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictive significance of demographic and clinical factors. Setting. Twenty health care sites across Arkansas. Participants. A total of 2,350 predominantly rural, lower SES, Arkansas residents. Intervention. Evidence-based, six-session, multi-component cognitive-behavioral therapy with relapse prevention. Results. The estimated percent abstinent was 26.47% at 3-months and 21.73% at 12-months post-treatment; 51.02% of patients completed treatment and demonstrated markedly higher quit rates. Although numerous factors predicted outcomes at different points, self-efficacy and dependence levels at intake were robust predictors across time and methods of calculating outcomes. Sex, partner smoking status, and educational level were significant predictors of long-term abstinence. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that intensive, evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence can be successfully delivered in a statewide program and can yield long-term outcomes that approximate those seen in more controlled settings. Overall sample estimates may be more appropriate for the assessment of outcomes in this context. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Conduct a process evaluation of a low-fat, high-fruit/vegetable dietary intervention in religious organizations (ROs). The purpose of this process evaluation was to explore differences in healthy eating activities between the intervention and delayed control ROs and among the intervention ROs to identify the intervention activities most associated with dietary change. Methods. Process data were collected via phone surveys and participation logs. A 12-month follow-up phone survey was conducted with an RO representative from intervention and delayed control ROs. The survey asked about healthy eating activities. Eating for a Healthy Life staff maintained participation logs of intervention RO participation in intervention activities. advisory board meetings, volunteer activities, healthy eating sessions, social events, dietary change mailings, print advertisements, and motivational messages. We used a stepwise regression model to determine which intervention activities were associated with changes in fat- and fiber-related dietary behaviors. Results. RO member participation in advisory board meetings, social activities, and healthy eating sessions were associated with healthier fat- and fiber-related dietary behaviors. Greater RO attendance at advisory board meetings and greater numbers of healthy eating sessions at the RO were associated with decreased fat-related dietary behaviors (p .05). Member participation in social activities was associated with more favorable fat, fruit, and vegetable intake. Conclusion. We successfully delivered an increased number of healthy activities at the intervention ROs and improved dietary-related behaviors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To assess the efficacy of an intervention designed to increase appropriate use of breast self-examination (BSE). Methods. Two-armed randomized clinical trial of cancer-control interventions in women that compared a BSE intervention program to a dietary intervention, which served as the control group. The study was conducted at a large health maintenance organization in Portland, Oregon. Participants were 616 female members of the health maintenance organization who were aged 40 to 70 years. The intervention consisted of a 30- to 45-minute individual counseling session that featured BSE instruction, training and practice with silicone models, identification of barriers to BSE, and problem-solving. This intervention was followed by two brief follow-up telephone calls. The study outcome measure was self-reported BSE practice, which included duration, frequency, and specific elements of exam. Results. The study had a 90% response rate. At the 1-year follow-up, χ² analyses showed that significantly more individuals in the BSE intervention (59%) reported adequate BSE performance compared with those in the control group (12.2%; p < .001). Conclusions. This brief intervention was successful in encouraging women to perform adequate BSEs. Although the role of the BSE in patient care remains controversial, these results show that even brief intervention programs can be effective at encouraging self-screening for cancer. This intervention could easily be modified to target other screening practices (e.g., skin or testicular cancer screening) that are associated with reduced cancer morbidity and mortality.

AB- Purpose. To identify barriers to parents' support of their children's physical activity (PA) and to develop a survey to assess such barriers. Methods. Eighty-two parents (40 white; 36 African-American; 6 other) of elementary school-aged children participated in small-group interviews. Parents reported barriers to supporting their children's PA and suggested possible solutions. This information was used to develop the Barriers to Activity Support Scale (BASS), which was completed by 75 of the 82 parents along with a survey that assessed the parents' support for their children's PA. Results. Parents reported community-based, interpersonal, and intrapersonal barriers to supporting their children's PA. Top barriers included the importance of children's school performance, a lack of facilities, and concerns about safety. Parents who reported greater barriers reported lower support for their children's PA. Discussion. Results provide preliminary evidence for the reliability and validity of the BASS and highlight the need to address barriers during the development of family-based PA programs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The health benefits of strength training must be weighed against risks, including injuries. A prior study observed 4.2 injuries that limited usual activities for a day per 1000 strength training sessions among men and women. The analysis herein explores the incidence rates of musculoskeletal injuries from strength training in women. Design. Randomized controlled trial. Setting. Free-living community. Subjects. A total of 163 injury-free, overweight, sedentary, premenopausal women aged 25 to 44 years. Intervention. Two years of strength training (n = 81) or standard care (n = 82). The intervention followed published guidelines (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) with hypothesized injury prevention strategies. Measures. An injury survey was administered at years 1 and 2. Injury was defined as physical activity or strength training associated injuries that limited daily activities for 1 week or more. Denominators for rate calculation were accelerometer-measured physical activity and strength training attendance (strength training only). The between-group probability of injuries was assessed using generalized estimating equations. Results. Injury incidence rates were higher in strength training compared with standard care. In strength training, the injury rates were 3.6 per 1000 strength training sessions (95% confidence interval. 2.5-4.8 per 1000) for physical activity--related injuries, and 2.6 per 1000 (95% confidence interval. 1.5-3.6 per 1000) for strength training-related injuries. Conclusions. Injury rates varied by definition and denominator. Strength training had lower injury rates than previously reported, providing preliminary support for the prevention strategies. The finding of strength training injuries underscores the need for balancing the benefits against the potential risks of this exercise modality. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To explore the factors that contribute to children's screen-related sedentary (S-RS) behaviors. Settings. Elementary schools. Subjects. A random sample of children in grades five and six and their parents. Measures. The outcome measure was children's S-RS activity level measured by a self-administered questionnaire. A full spectrum of potential contributing factors for children's S-RS behaviors was obtained through surveys. Multilevel linear regression methods were used to determine the associations between these factors and children's screen time (hours per day) and results were expressed as regression coefficients (g). Results. Of 955 child-parent pairs in 14 participating schools, 508 pairs (53%) completed the surveys. At an intrapersonal level, protective factors included being a girl (g = -.71); belonging to a sports team inside (g = -.56) or outside (g = -.49) of school; having a negative attitude toward S-RS activities (g = -.13); and having a positive attitude toward physical activity (g = -.48). At the interpersonal and social levels, parental leisure S-RS behaviors (g = .32) were positively associated, whereas strict parental rules on computer use (g = -.27) and family income (g = -.32) were inversely correlated with S-RS behavior. At the environmental level, the presence of TVs in children's bedrooms (g = .44) and owning videogame devices (g = .58) increased the risk of S-RS behaviors, whereas after school programs (g = -.86) and schools' participation in the Turn Off the Screen Week campaign (g = -.91) decreased the risk. Conclusions. Public health interventions should target multilevel factors, including increasing children's awareness, promoting parental involvement in healthy lifestyle pursuits, and creating less screenogenic environments.

AB- The article presents an examination of the effectiveness of employee health management (EHM) programs. The reasons for U.S. employers to be attracted to EHM programs are described, noting that they allow employers to provide for the health and productivity of employees in a way that allows costs to be reduced in other health care-related areas while remaining competitive in terms of their health benefits compared with those of other employers. The large initial investment for employers in initiating EHM programs and the long period of time before they will see a positive return on investment (ROI) are also noted.

AB- Objective. Categorize and describe the content and status of state legislation of worksite wellness. Methods. State worksite wellness legislation was compiled from the Centers for Disease Control's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity State Legislative Database (http://apps.nccd. cdc.gov/DNPALeg/index.asp) and from LexisNexis (hltp://www.lexisnexis.com). Key word searches were used to gather worksite wellness legislation (2001-2006), with the exception of resolutions and those bills not pertaining to general employee wellness. Legislation was individually examined, categorized, and analyzed for content and status. Results. The four categories of state legislation that appeared to be most common were tax credits (n = 34; 0 passed), wellness policies and programs (n = 21; 4 passed), alternative transportation (n = 18; 4 passed), and health insurance (n = 14; 3 passed). conclusion. During 2001 to 2006, seven of 27 states enacted worksite wellness hills. In the three categories in which bills passed (wellness policies and programs, alternative transportation, and health insurance), 19% to 22% were enacted. This proportion, similar to other health promotions bills, indicates that worksite health promotion legislation passed as favorably as other health promotion topics. Furl her the language in the bills did not recommend a specific standard for employee health, such as that in the national Healthy People 2010 objectives. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of a commonly used fingerstick technology to identify individuals with abnormal blood levels of total cholesterol (TC), calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) compared with a standardized laboratory. Methods. Participants (n = 250; mean age, 48.0 ± 13.5 years; 66% female; 36% nonwhite) were eligible for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Blood lipids and hsGRP were measured simultaneously by (1) fingerstick analyzed by Cholestech LDX analyzers and (2) fresh venous blood that was analyzed by Columbia University General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) Core Laboratory. Pearson correlation coefficients, kappa, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for fingerstick versus GCRC laboratory values for lipids and hsCRP. Results. The correlations between fingerstick and core laboratory for TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, and hsCRP were .91, .88, . 77, .93, and .81, respectively (all p < .01). Sensitivity and specificity of the fingerstick to identify those with abnormal lipids and hsCRP ≥ 1 mg/L were all ≥ 75%. Conclusion. Fingerstick screening is accurate and has good clinical utility to identify persons with abnormal blood lipids and hsCRP at the point of care in a diverse population that is eligible for primary prevention of CVD. These results may not be generalizable to patients at high risk for CVD or who have known hyperlipidemia. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine behavioral, demographic, psychosocial, and sociocultural concomitants of the stages of change for physical activity behavior among college students in South Korea (n = 221) and the United Stales (n = 166). Methods. Measures obtained in this cross-sectional study included age; body mass index; nationality; gender; exercise behavior; processes of change; decisional balance; self-efficacy; stage of change; and predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors. Results. The amount of variance explained for stage of change by the transtheoretical model constructs (i.e., decisional balance, processes of change, self-efficacy) ranged from 11 % to 29% (all p < .001), whereas the predisposing (2%; p = .052), reinforcing (3%; p = .06), and enabling (5%; p < .001) factors were not as important. In multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis, gender (odds ratio [OR] = 3.3; p < .001), gender by nationality interaction (OR = .27; p < .01), weekly exercise behavior (OR = 1.04; p < .001), and behavioral processes of change (OR 1.12; p < .001) were each significant concomitants of the stages of change. Discussion. In terms of physical activity behavior, South Korean women were more likely than South Korean men to be in the early stages, whereas American men were slightly more likely to be in the early stages than American women when all the concomitants were accounted for. Among the psychosocial stage of change concomitants, only the behavioral processes of change were found to be important. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Describe the relationship among modifiable health behaviors and short-term medical costs. Design. Prospective study linking cross-sectional survey data that assessed modifiable risk behaviors with insurance claims. Setting. A large health plan in Minnesota. Subjects. A stratified, random sample of 10,000 yielded an analytic data set for 7983 members. Measures. The dependent variable was per-member-per-month insurance payment plus subscriber liability. Eighteen months of medical costs were analyzed. Control variables included subscriber age, sex, type of insurance plan, days of enrollment, chronic disease status, education, and marital status. Independent variables included self-reported health behaviors of smoking, heavy drinking, nutrition, and physical activity. Analysis. Linear regression was performed on the natural log of the cost variable, followed by a retransformation to dollars. Results. Physical inactivity and smoking were significant predictors of higher medical costs. Each day a member did not exercise there was a 2.9% difference in cost. Compared with never smokers, current smokers had 16% higher costs. Former smokers who had quit more than 1 year before taking the survey had 15% higher costs than never smokers. Recent former smokers cost 32% more than never smokers and more frequently experienced smoking-related medical conditions before they quit. Alcohol consumption was nonsignificant. Nutrition also was not significant but was narrowly measured by only fruit and vegetable consumption. conclusion. Physical inactivity and smoking were associated with higher short-term medical costs among health plan members. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine relationships between the neighborhood food environment and fruit and vegetable intake in a multiethnic urban population. Design. Analysis of cross-sectional survey and observational data. Setting. One hundred forty-six neighborhoods within three large geographic communities of Detroit, Michigan. Subjects. Probability sample of 919 African-American, Latino, and white adults. Measures. The dependent variable was mean daily fruit and vegetable servings, as measured by using a modified Block 98 food frequency questionnaire. Independent variables included the neighborhood food environment: store availability (i.e., large grocery, specialty, convenience, liquor, small grocery), supermarket proximity (i.e., street-network distance to nearest chain grocer), and perceived and observed neighborhood fresh fruit and vegetable supply (i.e., availability, variety, quality, affordability). Analysis. Weighted, multilevel regression. Results. Presence of a large grocery store in the neighborhood was associated with, on average, 0.69 more daily fruit and vegetable servings in the full sample. Relationships between the food environment and fruit and vegetable intake did not differ between whites and African-Americans. However, Latinos, compared with African-Americans, who had a large grocery store in the neighborhood consumed 2.20 more daily servings of fruits and vegetables. Presence of a convenience store in the neighborhood was associated with 1.84 fewer daily fruit and vegetable servings among Latinos than among African-Americans. Conclusion. The neighborhood food environment influences fruit and vegetable intake, and the size of thus relationship may vary far different racial/ethnic subpopulations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the contextual effects of neighborhood built and social environments on exercise. Design. Cross-sectional, multilevel study. Setting. City of Chicago. Subjects. A probability sample of Chicago adult residents (response rate = 55%). Measures. The exercise measures were based on two questions: "How often a week on average do you work out or exercise?" (N = 3530) and, "Did you exercise regularly in the last year?" (N = 907). Neighborhood social environment was measured by socioeconomic and social capital indicators. Neighborhood built environment was captured by pedestrian injury rate, residential density, distance to subway or parks, land use mix, and access to neighborhood amenities. Analysis. Random effects logit and multinomial models. Results. For weekly workout/exercise, individuals with access to restaurants and bars were more likely to report one to three times of weekly exercise (OR = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.19) and four times or more weekly exercise (OR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.26) compared with those who reported no weekly exercise. For regular exercise in the past year, access to restaurants and bars (OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.46) and neighborhood social environment (OR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.69) were significant. The social environment effects were stronger for women. Conclusions. Neighborhood social and built environments are both important for exercise independent of an individual's background.

AB- Background. Despite the implementation of a host of tobacco control initiatives, tobacco use among active duty members of the US. Military remains high. It has been suggested that a positive culture of tobacco, which drives consumption, exists in the military. However, little is know about factors that impact tobacco use among military personnel. Objective. This study provides the first formative data on the culture of tobacco in the U.S. Military. Methods. A total of 15 focus groups on six military installations were conducted (n 189). These military installations were located throughout the continental United States and were of average size for each service. Results. Participants suggested that the primary method the military uses to discourage use is tobacco bans. Unfortunately, they also believed that the military accommodates tobacco use so that smoking remains convenient despite the bans on tobacco use. Smoking was believed to be encouraged through liberal smoking breaks, social interaction within designated smoking areas, and cheap and convenient tobacco products sold on military installations. Additionally, smoking was seen as an effective method to combat the stress and boredom of military life and to avoid weight gain. Conclusions. Suggestions for addressing the culture of tobacco are suggested. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Explore the impact of general parenting style and specific food-related parenting practices on children's dietary habits. Design. Cross-sectional study of sixth graders and their parents. Setting. Data were gathered (in 2003) in 69 of 100 randomly selected elementary schools in Belgium. Subjects. All sixth graders (N = 1957) were invited to participate; 82.4% of their parents gave consent and completed questionnaires, resulting in 1614 parent-child pairs. Measures. Children's consumption of breakfast, fruit, vegetables, soft drinks, and sweets was assessed by self-administered food frequency questionnaires. Parents completed questionnaires on sociodemographic characteristics, general parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative, indulgent, or neglecting) and specific food-related parenting practices (pressure, reward, encouragement through negotiation, catering on children's demands, permissiveness, avoiding negative modeling, and praise). Analysis. Logistic regression analyses were performed, with general parenting style and specific food-related parenting practices as predictors and dietary habits as dependent variables, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and children's weight status. Results. General parenting style did not show any significant impact on dietary habits. In contrast, the food-related parenting practice "encouragement through negotiation" showed a significant positive impact, whereas "pressure," "catering on demand, "and "permissiveness" were practices with an unhealthy impact. Conclusion. Nutrition education programs that guide parents in firm but not coercive food parenting skills are likely to have a positive impact upon children's dietary habits. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of a physical activity and nutrition curriculum for middle-school students. Design. Nonexperimental pilot evaluation of a statewide dissemination trial. Setting. California middle schools during the 2006 to 2007 school year. Subjects. Sixteen classes (N = 668 students and 16 teachers,) sampled from the statewide pool who used the program. Intervention. An eight-lesson nutrition and physical activity curriculum, "Exercise Your Options" (EYO), including a teacher guide, video clips, a student activity booklet, and ancillary materials was made available to teachers. Measures. Program records, classroom observations, teacher surveys, and student presurveys and postsurveys (assessing physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and dietary intake). Analysis. Descriptive statistics and multilevel random-coefficient modeling. Results. The EYO program reached 234,442 middle-school students in California. During the program, total physical activity increased (p < .001), whereas watching TV/DVDs and playing electronic games/computer use decreased (p < .05). Intake of dairy products increased (p < .05), whereas consumption of sugars/sweets decreased (p < .001). Forty-two percent of eligible middle-school classrooms ordered the program materials. Eighty-six percent of sampled teachers implemented all of the lessons. Over the past 5 years, 51 % of all middle-school students in California were exposed to the program. Conclusions. The EYO program showed its potential for moderate to high public health impact among California middle-school students. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Most public health physical activity guidelines now encourage people to look for opportunities to accumulate physical activity throughout the day. Climbing stairs in lieu of riding escalators is a prime opportunity to make healthier choices that promote active living. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of pedestrian commuter traffic on choices to ride an escalator, walk up an escalator, or walk up adjacent stairs in a busy urban subway station at rush hour. Design. A total of 9766 commuters were observed by two recorders for a 2.5-hour period during the morning rush hour over 8 weeks as to whether the commuters walked up stairs or rode an adjacent escalator in a subway station. The number of observations per 5-minute block was recorded, and an index of commuter traffic was computed. Demographic information and use of escalators/stairs were also. recorded. Setting. An urban subway station with a two-flight staircase adjacent to an escalator. Participants. Adult commuters travelling to work during the morning rush hour. Measures. Physical activity choices were examined in relation to commuter traffic. Demographic information, such as age, race, and weight status, were also considered. Analysis. A χ² analysis was used to examine differences in proportions across variables of interest. Means were compared by using multivari ate analysis of variance, and confidence intervals were computed. Results. During the least-heavy commuter traffic period, only 11.2% of commuters chose to walk up the stairs, whereas significantly more did so during moderate 18. 7% and high 20.8% commuter traffic periods (χ² = 61.8, p <.001). During low-traffic times, significantly more commuters (21.4%) walked up the escalators compared with moderate-traffic (18.0%) or high-traffic (18.3%) periods. African-American commuters passively rode the escalator more (68.2%) than white commuters (56. 7%), and their patterns were less affected by commuter traffic (p <.05). Conclusion. Congestion in public places can have a significant effect on opportunities for choosing active versus passive options in moving through public places. Urban planners should consider this when designing facilities in busy locations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the impact of "point of decision" messages on fruit selection in a single dining hall setting. Setting. Competitive undergraduate liberal arts college in the southeastern United States. Intervention. "Point of decision" messages were compiled into a 35-slide multimedia PowerPoint presentation. Messages were displayed on a computer screen at a "point of decision" between the cookie and fruit stations during lunch for a total of 9 days. Measures. Baseline cookie and fruit consumption was measured 9 days prebaseline and 9 days postbaseline. A random sample of students completed surveys 1 week after the intervention. Analysis, t-tests were used to examine differences between prelevels of fruit consumption and levels measured simultaneously during "point of decision" messages. Descriptive statistics were used to examine perceptions of survey items 1 week postintervention. Results. A significant mean difference in daily fruit consumption was found following the slide presentation (df-8, t = -2.800; p = .023). Average daily fruit consumption at baseline was 408 (SD = 73.43). Postbaseline average daily fruit consumption significantly increased (533; SD = 102). No significant prebaseline and postbaseline cookie differences were found (p = .226). Approximately 71 % of women and 68% of men noticed the "point of decision" messages. Nineteen percent of women and 10% of males reported modifying their food selection as a result of viewing the messages. Conclusion. The "point of decision " messaging significantly influenced fruit selection in a single dining hall setting. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

They briefly note the launch of a U.S. National Physical Activity Plan, called "Health People 2000," in May 2010, which is a comprehensive approach that involves public and private entities covering all aspects of society, with the aim of including physical activity into the U.S. culture. They further note that of the 13 physical activity objectives outlined in "Health People," the only objective to be achieved was increased work site fitness programs. They discuss why exercise has not been embraced by the U.S. medical community or health care system the way other major determinants of health have been and the economic benefits of exercise, which they argue are not limited to health.

AB- Purpose. An audience-centered approach was used to develop valid and reliable scales to measure adult self-efficacy to eat fruit and vegetables. Design. Cross-sectional survey of a national population. Setting. New Zealand. Subjects. A sample of 350 adults ages 25 to 60 years was randomly selected from a nationally representative sampling frame. Overall 231 questionnaires were returned, producing a 72% response rate. The mean age of subjects was 42.7 years; 58% were female; 80% were of European descent; 11% were indigenous Maori. Measures. The 76-item, self-administered questionnaire collected data on demographics, fruit and vegetable intakes, stages of change, decisional balance, and self-efficacy (24 items). Analysis. Principal components analysis with oblimin rotation was performed. Results. Principal components analysis yielded three distinct and reliable scales for self-efficacy to eat "vegetables, " "fruit," and "fruit and vegetables" (Cronbach α = .80, .85, and. 73, respectively). These scales were correlated, but only the "vegetable" scale was positively correlated with the "fruit and vegetable" scale (Kendall tau r = 0.30, -0.26 [fruit, "fruit and vegetables"], -0.38 [fruit, vegetable]). As predicted, self-efficacy was associated with intake (r = 0.30 [fruit], 0.34 [vegetables]). Conclusion. Assuming the factor structure is confirmed in independent samples, these brief psychometrically sound scales may be used to assess adult self-efficacy to eat fruit and to eat vegetables (separately) but not self-efficacy to eat "fruit and vegetables."

AB- Purpose. Examine variation in obesity among older adults relative to the joint influences of density of neighborhood fast food outlets and residents' behavioral, psychosocial and sociodemographic characteristics. Design. Cross-sectional and multilevel design. Setting. Census block groups, used as a proxy for neighborhoods, within the metropolitan region's Urban Growth Boundary in Portland, Oregon. Subjects. A total of 1221 residents (mean age, 65 years) recruited randomly from 120 neighborhoods (48% response rate). Measures. A geographic information system-based measure of fast food restaurant density across 120 neighborhoods was created. Residents within the sampled neighborhoods were assessed with respect to their body mass indices (BMI), frequency of visits to local fast food restaurants, fried food consumption, levels of physical activity, self-efficacy of eating fruits and vegetables, household income, and race/ethnicity. Analyses. Multilevel logistic regression analyses. Results. Significant associations were found between resident-level individual characteristics and the likelihood of being obese (BMI ≥ 30) for neighborhoods with a high-density of fast food restaurants in comparison with those with a low density: odds ratios for obesity, 95% confidence intervals (CI), were 1.878 (CI, 1.006-3.496) for weekly visits to local fast food restaurants; 1.792 (CI, 1.006-3.190) for not meeting physical activity recommendations; 1.212 (CI, 1.057-1.391) for low confidence in eating healthy food; and 8.057 (CI, 1.705- 38.086) for non-Hispanic black residents. Conclusion. Increased density of neighborhood fast food outlets was associated with unhealthy lifestyles, poorer psychosocial profiles, and increased risk of obesity among older adults.

AB- Purpose. Document changes from 2000 to 2004 in youth reports of exposure to pro-tobacco messages in the mass media, including images of smoking and tobacco advertising. Design. Comparison of cross-sectional data from three waves of the school-based National Youth Tobacco Surveys conducted in 2000 (N= 33,772), 2002 (N= 23,439), and 2004 (N= 23,540). Setting. Public and private middle schools and high schools across the United States. Subjects. Students in grades 6 through 12. Measures. Smoking status; exposure to images of smoking on television and in movies; exposure to advertisements for tobacco products in stores, on the Internet, and in newspapers and magazines; demographic data. Results. Youth exposure to pro-tobacco messages declined within all media channels studied from 2000 to 2004, except the Internet. Despite these declines, most youth in the United States remain exposed to pro-tobacco messages: 81% saw images of smoking on television or in movies (down from 90%), 85% saw tobacco ads in stores (down from 88%), 50% saw tobacco ads in newspapers and magazines (down from 66%), and 33% saw tobacco ads on the Internet (up from 22%). Conclusion. Despite recent progress in this area, most youth in the United States are still at increased risk of smoking as a result of exposure to pro-tobacco messages in the mass media.

AB- Purpose. Examine the extent to which restrained eating (RE) and changes in RE influence the risk of weight and fat gain over 36 months in women. Design. Prospective cohort. Setting. Several communities. Subjects. Baseline and follow-up assessments were completed by 192 middle-aged women (ages 40.0 ± 3 years). Measures. Body weight was measured with an electronic scale, body fat (BF) was assessed using the Bod Pod, energy intake was evaluated using 7-day weighed food records, physical activity was measured objectively using accelerometers, and RE was indexed using the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Analysis. Relative risk (RR) was calculated using incidence data. Results. The risk of weight gain (≥ 1 kg) over the 36 months was 69% greater in women who did not increase in RE compared with their counterparts (RR = 1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.52). The risk of substantial weight gain (≥ 3 kg) was 138% greater in women who did not increase in RE compared with women who did (RR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.16-4.89), and the risk of gains in BF (≥ 1% point) was 49% greater (RR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.02-2.17). Control of potential confounding factors, except changes in energy intake, had little influence on risk. Conclusion. Women who do not become more restrained in their eating over time are at much greater risk of gaining weight and BF compared with those who become more restrained. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine unionized workers' knowledge and attitudes about workplace tobacco use~ their exposure to secondhand smoke, and the role of labor unions in addressing smoking and cessation coverage policies. Design. Random-digit dial telephone survey. Subjects. Unionized workers in Minnesota (N = 508). Measures. Knowledge and attitudes about workplace tobacco use and tobacco control policy making. Analysis. Multiple logistic regression. Results. The majority of respondents viewed secondhand smoke exposure as an important workplace health and safety issue, a health risk to nonsmokers, and a driver of increased health care costs, but smokers were less likely than nonsmokers to agree. Only 7% of respondents supported their unions taking the lead in tobacco control policy making. A large majority of those surveyed rated smoking cessation programs as an important benefit for which their labor unions could bargain; however, smokers and those whose workplaces allowed smoking were less likely than their counterparts to agree. Conclusions. Most unionized workers were aware of the health effects of exposure to secondhand smoke and supported union bargaining for restrictions on workplace smoking and cessation programs, although few workers supported their unions taking the lead in initiating worksite smoking policies. Results suggest that campaigns to promote smoke-free worksites should be tailored to unionized workers, and further collaborations with labor unions to promote policy change are needed.

AB- Purpose. 3 For Life aims to increase hepatitis B virus (HBV) awareness and reduce the high prevalence of undiagnosed chronic HBV infection and susceptibility among Asian/Pacific Islander (API) adults. Design. This pilot program offered low-cost HBV vaccination with free HBV testing targeted primarily at foreign-born Chinese adults. Setting. Semimonthly screening and vaccination clinics were held in San Francisco, California, for 1 year. Subjects. A total of 1206 adults accessed the program. Intervention. Participants paid a discounted fee for a full vaccine series against HBV, hepatitis A virus (HA V), or both. Participants also provided blood samples for HBV serologic testing. Test results, recommendations, and appointment reminders were provided by mail. Measures. We compared the probability of completing a recommended vaccine series by HBV serologic status and sociodemographic characteristics. Analysis. Proportions were compared using multivariate logistic regression models. Results. Nine percent of adults were chronically infected with HBV, and 53% were unprotected. In the latter group, 85% completed the HBV vaccine series. The probability of completing a recommended hepatitis vaccine series was similar across most sociodemographic groups, with slightly higher completion rates among middle-aged and Chinese participants. Conclusions. Lessons learned from this pilot program have been used toward successful replication in other cities, demonstrating that 3 For Life is an accessible, affordable, reproducible, and sustainable model to increase HBV awareness, testing, and prevention among API adults.

AB- Purpose. This study investigates the relationship between patterns of health behaviors and the use of cancer-screening tests while controlling for sociodemographic and health system factors. Design. Cross-sectional analysis of the 2000 National Health Interview (NHIS). Setting. Nationally representative sample. Subjects. Adults 50 years and older. Measures. Use of cancer-screening tests, health behaviors, sociodemographic factors, and health system factors from self-reported responses from the NHIS. Sixteen health behavior patterns were identified based on lifestyle recommendations for physical activity, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Results. Health behavior patterns, age, educational attainment, usual source of care, and health insurance were significantly associated with the use of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening (p < .05). Approximate R² for the four models ranged from .067 for colorectal cancer screening in women to .122 for cervical cancer screening Having a usual source of care was the strongest correlate of screening the magnitude of associations for health behavior patterns and demographic variables and screening was similar and much smaller than those for usual source of care. Conclusion. These findings demonstrate relationships between patterns of multiple health behaviors and use of recommended cancer-screening tests, even when accounting for factors known to influence test use. This suggests potential for addressing cancer screening in the context of multiple behavior change interventions once barriers to health care access are removed. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. Analyze evidence of the benefits of physical activity for youth with developmental disabilities. Data Sources. Key word searches for "disability," "physical activity," "exercise," "fitness," and "sport" in major databases. A total of 3263 citations was found. Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. Systematic reviews and articles about studies quantitatively examining the effects of physical activity in youth with developmental disabilities ages 0 to 20 years were included. Only articles Published in English in peer-reviewed journals were included. Data Extraction. A Measurement Tool to Assess Reviews criteria were used for systematic reviews; Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, Evaluation criteria were used for observational studies; and Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome criteria were used for all studies. Data Synthesis. Data, shown in table format, were synthesized in relation to five research questions. Results. Three systematic reviews and 14 studies were reviewed. Strong evidence indicated that children and adolescents with developmental disabilities derive health benefits from participation in group exercise programs, treadmill training, or therapeutic riding/hippotherapy. Lesser levels of evidence indicated that health benefits might be present for adapted skiing or aquatic programs. Documented benefits of physical activity include improvements in aerobic capacity, improved gross motor function, and high levels of participant/parent satisfaction. Conclusions. Evidence exists that physical activity is beneficial for youth with developmental disabilities. Further research studies are needed that are of greater scientific rigor including larger sample sizes, control groups, and stringent, replicable methodology.

The study expands research on accessibility, comparing compliance scores of aquatic facilities in North Texas built before the 1991 Title III Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) with facilities built after the 1991 ADAAG and the proposed 2002 supplement. Design. A quasi-experimental design directed the selection of 52 facilities where measurements were taken to determine compliace with ADAAG and the supplement. A focus group provided insight into interpreting which features functioned as barriers or constraints to participation. Setting. Metropolitan statistical area in North Texas. Subjects. A total of 52 aquatic facilities and 12 focus group participants (University of North Texas institutional review board 07-283). Measure. ADA aquatic facility compliance instrument. Analysis. Frequency, ratios. Results. No facilities were 100 % ADA compliant overall, although some facilities were 100% compliant with specific structured domains. Women's restrooms rated lowest (average = 55%), and men's restrooms received the second lowest rating (average = 64%). Focus group result indicated that improperly designed restrooms and pool entries are primary barriers to participation. Conclusion. The findings support a need for stronger enforcement of policies that improve accessibility of facilities. Architectural reviews and construction practices need to be improved. The structural barriers and constraints identified can be limiting factors in efforts aimed at increasing physical activity among individuals with disabilities and individuals with physical limitations.

AB- Purpose. To examine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) in Illinois and associated risk factors to document emerging problems as a basis for preventive and/or therapeutic interventions. Design. The 2005 Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were analyzed for prevalence rates and relative risk (RR) of risk factors for MS. Setting. Illinois. Subjects. Representative sample of 5077 noninstitutionalized Illinoisans aged ≥ 18. Measures. Presence of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, angina, and obesity; adequate fruit/vegetable intake; adequate daily physical activity; routine consumption of calcium-rich foods; smoking; and demographic variables. Analysis. Prevalence, chi-square, RR, and analyses of variance. Results. MS prevalence was 16.2%. The RR for MS was 8 for those having diabetes; 20 for those with hypertension; 14 for those with hypercholesterolemia; 6 for those with angina; and 7 for those with obesity. Fruit/vegetable intake did not significantly influence the RR (RR = 1.01), but RR was greater when calcium-rich foods were not routinely consumed (RR = 1.61) and with inadequate physical activity (RR = 1.85). MS prevalence was highest in those over 65 years; with incomes <$15,000; and among Blacks. Differences among those with one through five indicators of MS were not Significant for fruit/vegetable intake, but were for physical activity, age group, income, and education level (p < .001). Conclusion. These findings reveal that MS prevention should be emphasized for lower-income, older Blacks. Increasing physical activity and calcium-rich foods are areas for community-based education.

AB- Purpose. Determine the effects of telephone-based coaching and a weight-loss supplement on the weight and body fat (BF) of overweight adults. Design. Randomized, placebo-controlled experiment with assessments at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. Setting. Community. Subjects. Sixty overweight or obese men and 60 overweight or obese women, 25 to 60 years Intervention. Eleven 30-minute telephone coaching sessions were spaced throughout the study; the initial conversation lasted 60 to 90 minutes. Supplement or placebo capsules were taken daily over the 17 weeks. Measures. Weight was measured using an electronic scale, and BF was assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Results. Subjects taking the placebo lost 1.8 ± 3.3 kg of weight and 0.7 ± 2.2 kg of BF, whereas supplement users lost more: 3.1 ± 3.7 kg of weight (F = 4.1, P = .045) and 1.7 ± 2.6 kg of BF (F = 4.4, p = .039). Participants receiving no coaching lost 1.8 ± 3.3 kg of weight and 0. 7 ± 2.2 kg of BF, whereas adults receiving coaching lost more: 3.2 ± 3.6 kg of weight (F = 4.8, p = .032) and 1.6 ± 2.5 kg of BF (F = 4.2, p = .044). Adults receiving both the supplement and coaching had the greatest losses of weight and BP, suggesting an additive effect (F = 3.2, p .026; F = 2.9, p = .039, respectively). Conclusions. Both treatments, coaching and the supplement, viewed separately and in combination, worked to help subjects lose weight and BF. Adults can be educated and motivated via telephone to change behaviors leading to weight loss, and a weight-loss supplement can be included to increase success. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. The purpose of this study was to use the Community Readiness Model to examine local smoke-free policy development. Design, Setting, and Subjects. A descriptive, cross-sectional design was used to assess 64 Kentucky communities. Dimensions of readiness included a community's knowledge of the problem and existing voluntary smoke-free policies; leadership for policy development; resources for policy development; climate surrounding policy development; existing voluntary policy efforts; and political climate for policy development. Dimension scores were summed to identify one of six overall readiness stages: (1) unawareness; (2) vague awareness; (3) preplanning; (4) preparation; (5) initiation; and (6) endorsement. Analyses. Correlations between dimensions and overall readiness scores were evaluated. One-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate regional trends, and multiple regression was used to assess the influence of sociodemographic/political variables on policy readiness. Results. The knowledge dimension rated highest, and community climate rated lowest. Most communities were in the lower stages of readiness. No relationship was found between overall readiness and region (F[4, 59] = 1.17; p > .05); nor were there regional differences among dimension scores. Smaller communities were less ready for local policy development than larger ones (adjusted R² = .25; p = .003). Conclusions. The Community Readiness Model is appropriate for understanding local policy development, and it provides advocates with information that may prove helpful in advancing smoke-free policy.

AB- Purpose. Describe and evaluate a media campaign to encourage 1 % or nonfat milk consumption. Design. Uncontrolled pre/post test. Setting. One largely rural (Santa Paula) and one urban (East Los Angeles) California community. Subjects. Community residents and milk vendors in primarily low-income Latino/Hispanic communities. Intervention. The "1 % or Less" milk campaign, which promotes substitution of 2% fat or whole milk with 1 % or less fat milk was adapted and implemented. Measures. Companson of post-campaign milk sales with pre-campaign sales. Analysis. Chi-square tests of independence used to compare precampaign and post campaign sales. Results. There were decreases in the proportion of whole milk sold and increases in the proportion of reduced-fat, low-fat, and nonfat milk sold in the weeks following each campaign (Santa Paula: p = .0165; East Los Angeles: p < .0001). However, follow-up data from East Los Angeles suggest that these changes were not sustained. The proportions of the different units of milk sold also changed in the weeks following each campaign (p < .0001). Sales of whole milk gallon units decreased from 36.3% to 28.4% in Santa Paula, and from 43.5% to 10.2% in East Los Angeles. Conclusion. Highly focused campaigns to promote substitution of high-fat milk with low-fat or nonfat milk can show dramatic initial changes in sales patterns. However, whether such campaigns can have a sustained impact in largely Latino/Hispanic communities is not evident. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. A critical review of the accuracy of salt consumption measurement can enhance future dietary sodium interventions. Data Source. A review of the measures of salt consumption was conducted with a focus on the measurement that may facilitate behavior modification. Measures were critiqued for factors known to threaten the validity of behavioral measurement in applied settings. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. The review included observational, interventional, and measurement studies that used at least one measure of behavior indicative of salt consumption. Data Extraction. Eighteen articles were retrieved by examining their definitions of salt consumption to ensure a measurement of behavior and a discussion of factors known to influence behavior and its measurement. Data Synthesis. Articles meeting the above criteria were critically reviewed for factors related to a valid measurement of behavior: participant and setting characteristics, measurement definitions, and measurement procedures. Results. The results indicate that imprecise definitions of salt consumption and insensitive measurement tools limit valid measurement of salt-eating behaviors. Conclusions. Further research is needed to improve the specificity of measures of behaviors that are indicative of salt consumption and to produce tools that clinicians and patients may use for more accurate, and possibly real-time, salt consumption measurement. The increasing burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging US. population demands better methods to assess and subsequently control salt consumption in applied settings. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is effective, but only one-half of age-eligible adults adhere to national guidelines. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) groups are less likely to be screened. Methods. Baseline data from a prospective study were used to examine the associations among CRC screening, screening barriers, and SES. A convenience sample of adults (N = 291) aged 40 years and older was recruited from a federally qualified health center. Questionnaires were administered orally and include demographics, health, health behavior, and screening barriers. Results. In logistic regression having health insurance was associated with greater odds of screening. Bivariate analyses detected few differences in fecal occult blood test (FOBT) barriers, but several endoscopy barriers wer more common among the lowest SES groups. For example, fear of injury from endoscopy was more likely among low-income and uninsured participants. Discussion. The impact of SES on cancer screening is complex, but low-SES participants more often reported certain barriers than their higher-SES counterparts. This was more evident for endoscapy than for FOBT. Programs targeted at low-SES patients may need to focus on barriers that are not fully addressed in traditional promotion efforts. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study examined whether brief intervention strategies founded on the Behavior- Image Model and addressing positive images of college and career success could be potentially efficacious in impacting multiple health habits of high-risk adolescents transitioning into adulthood. Design. Participants were stratified by grade level and druguse and individually randomized to one of the three Plan for Success interventions, with baseline and 1 month postintervention data collections. Setting. A large, relatively diverse suburban school in northeast Florida. Subjects. A total of 375 11th and 12th grade students participated during the spring semester 2006. Intervention. Three interventions studied included: (1) Goal Survey, (2) Goal Survey plus Contract, or (3) Goal Survey plus Consult. Measures. Outcome measures included multiple health risk, health promotion, and personal development behaviors, as well as image and belief measures. Analysis. Repeated-measures MANOVAs and ANOVAs were used to examine intervention effects. Results. MANOVAs were significant for alcohol use, F(4,328) = 6.33, p = .001; marijuana use, F(4,317) = 3.72, p = .01; exercise, F(3,299) = 4.28, p = .01; college preparation, F(2,327) = 6.26, p = .001; and career preparation, F(2,329) = 6.17, p = .001, with most behaviors improving over time, whereas group-by-time interaction effects were found for nutrition habits, F(6,652) = 2.60, p = .02; and career preparation, F(4, 658) = 3.26, p = .01, favoring the consultation. Conclusion. Brief interventions founded on the Behavior-Image Model may have potential to improve selected health and personal development habits among older adolescents. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine whether the amount of television (TV) watched by participants enrolled in a physical activity intervention mediates or moderates program effectiveness. Design. Nine-month, controlled, school-based physical activity intervention. Setting. Public high school. Participants. One hundred twenty-two sedentary adolescent females (mean ± standard deviation age = 15.04 ± 0. 79 years). Intervention. Supervised in-class exercise, health education, and internet-based self-monitoring. Measures. Physical activity by 3-day physical activity recall; TV viewing by self-reports; cardiovascular fitness by cycle ergometer. Analysis. T-tests were conducted to examine between-group dzfferences. Linear regression equations tested the mediating or moderating role of TV watching relative to the intervention. Results. TV viewing moderated the intervention's effect on vigorous activity; the intervention significantly predicted change in physical activity among high (β = - .45; p < .001), but not among low (p > .05), TV watchers. TV viewing did not mediate the intervention effect. Conclusions. Consistent with displacement theory, adolescents who watched more TV prior to the intervention showed postintervention increases in vigorous physical activity and concomitant decreases in TV viewing, whereas those who watched less TV showed no change in physical activity or TV viewing.

AB- Purpose. To examine the association of worksite policies and environments to physical activity. Methods. Between 2001 and 2003, 977 adults from Missouri, Tennessee, and Arkansas participated in two random-digit-dialed telephone surveys regarding physical activity behaviors and worksite policies supporting physical activity. Logistic regression was used to investigate relationships between meeting national physical activity recommendations and supportive policies or environmental conditions (e.g., facilities, equipment, financial rewards) at worksites. Results. Having multiple policies at worksites was associated with meeting physical activity recommendations, specifically the provision of accessible stairways and personal services (e.g., fitness testing, counseling). Meeting recommendations through walking was associated with having exercise facilities (e.g., gym, shower) and equipment (e.g., treadmill, weights). Discussion. This study highlights the importance of supplementing health promotion information in workplaces with policies and environmental interventions. Particular consideration should be given to accessible stairways for onsite exercise and provision of exercise facilities and equipment. Future interventions should combine policy change with program delivery. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Investigate environmental factors influencing the use of recreational facilities for physical activity by urban African-American adolescents. Design. Qualitative in-depth interviews and direct observation. Setting. Two public high schools and 24 public recreational facilities in Baltimore, Maryland. Participants. Forty-eight African-American adolescents aged 14 to 18 years. Methods. Data from 48 in-depth interviews and 26 observations were coded using NVivo software and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Results. Facility use is influenced by characteristics of the physical, social, organizational, and economic environments. Adolescents are attracted to low-cost, well-maintained facilities that offer preferred activities and that are within close proximity to home. Adolescents with limited access to facilities use alternative play spaces, like the streets or vacant lots, where they risk injury from falling or being hit by a car. They are drawn to facilities where they find active adolescents, and they avoid those where young people are engaged in drug or gang activity. Concerns about facility safety largely determine use, particularly for adolescent girls. Conclusion. Previous research points to the importance of increasing facility availability as a means of promoting physical activity, particularly in minority communities in which availability is disproportionately limited. This study shows that, while availability is important, additional facility characteristics should be considered when using environmental change to promote facility use for physical activity.

AB- Purpose. This study tested a path model that included perceptions of social support and self-efficacy for leisure physical activity and leisure physical activity participation among adults with intellectual disabilities. Design. A cross-sectional design was used. Data was collected via oral interview. Setting. Community-based group, supported-living settings in one Midwestern state. Sample. A total of 152 adults with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, which provided a 39% response rate. Measures. Self-efficacy and social support (from family, residential staff and peers with disabilities) for leisure physical activity were assessed using self-reported scales. Leisure physical activity participation was measured with a self-reported checklist of the frequency of leisure physical activity participation. Analysis. Path analysis was conducted for the entire sample and was repeated for younger and older age groups. Results. The hypothesized model fit the data from each group. Social support and self-efficacy predicted physical activity participation, and self-efficacy served as a mediator between social support and physical activity. Significant sources of social support differed between groups; among younger participants, social support from family predicted physical activity, whereas, for the older group, social support from staff and peers predicted physical activity. Conclusion. Self-efficacy and social support for leisure physical activity are related to leisure physical activity participation among adults with intellectual disabilities who are receiving supported-living services. The results provide information to guide health promotion programs for this group. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Assess the effectiveness of a two-step health education program by nurses delivered through nonsmoking mothers to help fathers of sick children quit smoking. Design. Randomized, controlled trial. Setting. General pediatric wards of four major hospitals in Hong Kong. Subjects. Nonsmoking mothers who had a live-in smoking spouse were recruited when they brought sick children to the hospital. A total of 752 mothers were randomized into the intervention arm and 731 into the control arm. Intervention. The intervention group received standardized health advice, behavior modification booklets, and a 1-week telephone reminder. The control group received usual care. Measurements. The main outcome measure was the quit rate (7-day point prevalence) of smoking fathers as determined by telephone follow-up with mothers at 3 and 12 months. Quit attempts and smoking reduction were secondary outcome measures. Results. At 3 months, more fathers in the intervention group had quit smoking (7.4% vs. 4.8%; p = .03), reduced daily cigarette consumption by 50% or more (30.6% vs. 22.6%; p < .001), and reported quit attempts (6.5% vs. 3.6%; p = .01). The differences were not statistically significant by 12 months. Conclusion. A simple health education intervention provided by nurses to mothers of sick children has a short-term effect in helping smoking fathers quit, reduce consumption, and trigger quit attempts. Future studies should confirm the longer-term sustainability of the effect. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Wine consumption has been related to a reduced cardiovascular risk. This effect has been attributed partly to the healthier diet of wine drinkers. We compared food habits according to alcoholic beverage preference in a Mediterranean population. Design. A cross-sectional study of a large sample of participants at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Setting. Primary care centers in a Mediterranean country, Spain. Participants. A total of 1675 men aged 55 to 80 years old and 2150 women aged 60 to 80 years old who had no documented cardiovascular disease but had either diabetes or at least three major cardiovascular risk factors. Measures. A food frequency questionnaire, alcoholic beverage consumption, adherence to Mediterranean diet, age, family history of cardiovascular disease, smoking, body mass index, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and educational level were measured. Analysis. We analyzed differences in food consumption according to the type of alcoholic beverage preferentially consumed and adjusted the estimates for age, body mass index, cholesterol level, and total energy intake. Results. We found no substantial differences in adherence to the Mediterranean diet according to the main type of alcoholic beverage consumed, and we found no evidence that Mediterranean wine drinkers at high cardiovascular risk have a healthier diet than other drinkers. However, a better dietary pattern was found among nondrinkers than among drinkers. Conclusion. This large, Mediterranean study does not support an association between wine consumption and healthier dietary habits. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine the effect of happiness and life satisfaction on health. Design. Longitudinal data from waves 1 and 3, conducted in 2001 and 2004, respectively, of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. Setting. Australia. Subjects. A total of 9981 respondents aged 18 years and older. Measures. Outcomes were self-reported health; the absence of long-term, limiting health conditions; and physical health. Happiness was assessed with the following question: "During the past 4 weeks, have you been a happy person"? Life satisfaction was determined with the following question: "All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life"? Analysis. We used multiple regression analysis to estimate odds ratios (ORs), beta coefficients (...), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between baseline happiness or life satisfaction and health at wave 3. Results. Baseline happiness and life satisfaction both were positively associated at wave 3 with excellent, very good, or good health (OR= 1.50, CI= 1.33-1.70,p < .0001; and OR 1.62, CI= 1.27-2.08, p < .0001, respectively); with the absence of long-term, limiting health conditions (OR = 1.53, CI = 1.35-1.75, p < .0001; and OR = 1.51, CI = 1.25-1.82, p < .0001, respectively); and with higher physical health levels (... = .99, CI= .60-1.39, p < .0001; and ... = .99, CI .20-1.78, p < .0145, respectively). Conclusion. This study showed that happier people and those who were more satisfied with their lives at baseline reported better health (self-rated health; absence of limiting, long-term conditions; and physical health) at the 2-year follow-up when adjusted for baseline health and other relevant covariates.

AB- Purpose. To compare the effectiveness of home- and group-based, progressive resistance training programs and a group walking program in improving functional performance in older adults. Design. A quasi-experimental trial, in which retirement villages were assigned to one of three groups: home-based resistance training, group-based resistance training, and group-based walking. Subjects. One hundred sixty-seven retirement village residents aged 65 to 96 years. Intervention. Nine resistance training exercises, using graded exercise bands and body weight, two balance exercises, and 10 stretches. Home-based participants were given an exercise booklet, 8 hours of instruction, and telephone support. Instructors supervised the group-based resistance training and walking programs. Each group exercised twice weekly for 20 weeks. Measures. Functional performance (strength, aerobic endurance, flexibility, and agility/ dynamic balance) was assessed using the Senior Fitness Test. Analysis. Intervention effects were evaluated using mixed-model, repeated measures analysis of variance. Results. Significant between-group differences were observed only for the lower-body flexibility test. Group resistance training participants improved, but home resistance training and walking participants did not. However, strength, lower-body flexibility, and agility/dynamic balance improved in the group-based resistance training participants, and strength and upper-body flexibility improved in the home-based participants. No improvements were observed in the walking group. Conclusion. Findings support the implementation of both home- and group-based resistance training programs in retirement villages. Encouraging residents to adopt and maintain a resistance training program remains a research priority. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. The primary purposes of this review were to identify key social-environmental influences on the physical-activity behavior of women and to propose an organizing framework of these influences in the social environment. Data Sources. Computerized searches of MEDLINE, Science Direct, and CINAHL were conducted to identify relevant research. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Studies were included if they used a sample of adult women or included gender-specific analysis, identified or measured some aspect of the social environment in relation to physical activity, and were published in English within the last two decades. Data Extraction. Characteristics of study design, sample population, and identified social- environmental variables were extracted. Data Synthesis. Through an iterative review of the data by several researchers, common influences and themes were identified and organized into a social environment framework, which included the following components: social support/social networks, life transitions/ multiple roles, and cultural standards/gender role expectations. Results. Women are exposed to societal messages that indicate physical activity is not a priority and may be inappropriate; they may also lack the social support necessary to adopt and maintain physical activity. Conclusions. This review reveals the complex range of factors in the social environment that influence women, and it provides support for the importance of the social environment on physical-activity behavior in women. A social-environmental framework related to Bronfenbrenner's social ecological model is proposed along with recommended strategies to apply in interventions targeting women. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Present a 10-year update of the ecologic model of health promotion published by Richard et al. in the American Journal of Health Promotion in 1996. Approach. We adapted and simplifled the model by leaving out settings, focusing on levels, and incorporating interpersonal and individual levels and agents that are in control of environmental conditions. Setting. Health care facilities, schools, workplaces, living environments, and public environments were represented in program descriptions. Participants. Forty-three program coordinators responsible for 47 programs were interviewed in the United States and The Netherlands. Methods. A systematic interview protocol elicited general program descriptions and relevant aspects of the ecologic approach. Program aspects from written reports were coded by the authors into levels, interventions, targets, and strategies. Results. The programs had 234 strategies and 276 targets, with a mean of 2.15 levels. Twenty-seven distinct intervention strategies were identified, with the most common being modification of an organization to which the at-risk individuals belong, followed by policy and community changes. Conclusion. Our data fit the ecologic model and our adaptations and indicate that over the past decade health promotion practice may have changed to include more multilevel programs. Systematic analysis of program strategies within and across environmental levels allows better understanding of the social ecology of health-related behavior and potential leverage points for change.

AB- Purpose. Evaluate the relationship between neighborhood crime and the amount of daily walking by minority adults. Design. This was a cross-sectional study of minority adult walking behavior and crime. Setting. Oakland, California was chosen as the study area because of the substantial spatial variation in levels of criminal activity combined with detailed information on walking trips. Participants. The study was restricted to minority adults who responded to the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey and lived in Oakland, California (n = 359). Method. Data on leisure and utilitarian walking were collected through the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey and combined with crime data from the Oakland Police Department. A negative binomial model was used to test if violent, property, or quality of life crimes had significant associations with daily minutes walked, controlling for individual and neighborhood covariates. Results. The model showed a significant negative association between violent crime and minutes walked per day (b = - . 07; p = .016). Neither property nor quality of life crimes were correlated with amount of walking. Conclusions. Reductions in violent crime may increase opportunities for minority residents in urban areas to participate in physical activity such as walking, thereby providing another reason to pursue anticrime measures. Urban designers' efforts to increase physical activity by improving neighborhood walkability may consider violent crime prevention in their designs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To explore the relationship between the placement of fast-food outlets and neighborhood-level socioeconomic variables by determining if indicators of lower socioeconomic status were predictive of exposure to fast food. Design. A descriptive analysis of the fast-food environment in a Canadian urban center, using secondary analysis of census data and Geographic Information Systems technology. Setting. Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Measures. Neighborhoods were classified as High, Medium, or Low Access based on the number offast-food opportunities available to them. Neighborhood-level socioeconomic data (income, education, employment, immigration status, and housing tenure) from the 2001 Statistics Canada federal census were obtained. Analysis. A discriminant function analysis was used to determine if any association existed between neighborhood demographic characteristics and accessibility offast-food outlets. Results. Significant differences were found between the three levels offast-food accessibility across the socioeconomic variables, with successively greater percentages of unemployment, low income, and renters in neighborhoods with increasingly greater access to fast-food restaurants. A high score on several of these variables was predictive ofgreater access to fast-food restaurants. Conclusion. Although a causal inference is not possible, these results suggest that the distribution offast-food outlets relative to neighborhood-level socioeconomic status requires further attention in the process of explaining the increased rates of obesity observed in relatively deprived populations.

AB- Purpose. Examine the effects of three iterative tailored feedback letters addressing smoking; physical activity; and fruit, vegetable, and fat intake, and test the additional effects of providingfeedback on action plans. Design. A tailored, print-based intervention was developed and tested in a randomized control trial with a posttest after 9 months. Setting. A total of 2827 respondents agreed to participate. They were recruited from a random sample of 35,000 addresses obtained through the Dutch national telephone company. Subjects. The mean age was 49 years, and 55% were female. Intervention. The experimental group received three printed tailored letters, and the control group received three printed generic letters. Respondents from the experimental group randomly received either a third letter with tailored information or tailored information and action-planning feedback. Measures. The questionnaire assessed physical activity; smoking; consumption of fruit, vegetables and fat; motivational determinants; action plans; and demographics. Results. Tailored information resulted in more improvement over time than generic information for the intake offruit, vegetables, and fat and for physical activity. No differences between the conditions were found for smoking because of high cessation rates in all conditions. Action-planning feed back did not increase the effects. Conclusions. Tailored lifestyle information can be effective for adults in changing nutrition behavior and physical activity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. To update a previous systematic review on the effectiveness of worksite--based weight loss programs. Data Source. The following databases were searched: Medline, PsychIIVFO, Embase, The Cochrane Libraiy, and LexisNexis. Study Inclusion and Exclusion. Studies were limited to those published in English from 1995 to 2006 to which the following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) worksite intervention, (2) body weight assessed before and after intervention, and (3) study duration of at least 8 weeks. Data Extraction. Data were extracted on the following: study design; funding source; purpose of evaluation; participant and worksite characteristics; type, intensity and duration of intervention; primary and secondary outcomes; and methodological quality. Data Synthesis. Heterogeneity of study designs precluded quantitative data synthesis. Results. We identified 11 randomized controlled trials, most of which focused on education and counseling to improve diet and increase physical activity. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 18 months, with 56% to 100% of subjects completing the studies. The overall methodological quality of the studies was poor. Intervention groups lost significantly more weight than controls, with the mean difference in weight loss ranging from -0.2 to -6.4 kg. Conclusion. Worksite-based weight loss programs can result in modest shart improvements in body weight; however, long-term data on health and economic outcomes are lacking. So What? There is a need for rigorous controlled studies of worksite-based interventions that integrate educational, behavioral, environmental, and economic supports. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To examine cross-sectional associations between credit card debt, stress, and health risk behaviors among college students, focusing particularly on weight-related behaviors. Design. Random-sample, mailed survey. Subjects/Setting. Undergraduate and graduate students (n = 3206) attending a large public university. Measures. Self-reported health indicators (e.g., weight, height, physical activity, diet, weight control, stress, credit card debt). Results. More than 23% of students reported credit card debt ≥ $1000. Using Poisson regression to predict relative risks (RR) of health behaviors, debt of at least $1000 was associated with nearly every risk indicator tested, including overweight/obesity, insufficient physical activity, excess television viewing, infrequent breakfast consumption, fast food consumption, unhealthy weight control, body dissatisfaction, binge drinking, substance use, and violence. For example, adjusted RR [ARR] ranged from 1.09 (95% Confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.17) for insufficient vigorous activity to 2.17 (CI: 0.68-2.82) for uring drugs other than marijuana in the past 30 days. Poor stress management was also a robust indicator of health risk. Conclusion. University student lifestyles may be characterized by a variety of coexisting risk factors. These findings indicate that both debt and stress were associated with wide-ranging adverse health indicators. Intervention strategies targeting at-risk student populations need to be tailored to work within the context of the many challenges of college life, which may serve as barriers to healthy lifestyles. Increased health promotion efforts targeting stress, financial management, and weight-related health behaviors may be needed to enhance wellness among young adults. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To explore young, multi-ethnic adolescents' attitudes and influences related to cigarette smoking for the purpose of developing and producing a youth-led, tobacco-prevention drama. Design. Focus groups and demographic surveys. Setting. Island of Oahu, Hawaii. Participants. Fifty-four multi-ethnic youth, ranging in age from 10 to 14 years, participated. The study was promoted in schools with a large representation of Hawaiian, Filipino, and Pacific Islander students. Methods. Each of five focus groups was audio-recorded, and an observer recorded extensive notes throughout the sessions. Content analysis consisted of coding focus group notes for recurrent themes and using the audio recording as confirmation. Results. Just more than one quarter (n = 15) of the youth had tried smoking, and two-thirds (n = 35) currently lived with someone who smoked. Participants expressed the feeling of being surrounded by smoking influences at home, in their communities, and at school. Youth were negatively affected by family members' tobacco use, and they desired skills that could enable them to help family members stop using tobacco. Conclusion. Family influences may play an important role in youth attitudes toward tobacco use, especially given the cultural significance of extended family and of filial piety that are reflected in many traditional Asian and Pacific Islander families. Interventions targeting youth in Asian and Pacific Islander communities should incorporate key cultural references to the extended family and to a respect for elders to establish relevance in the life experiences of young people in these population groups.

AB- Purpose. To quantify the association between food insecurity and smoking among low-income families. Design and Setting. A retrospective study using data from the 2001 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a longitudinal study of a representative sample of US. men, women, and children and the family units in which they reside. Subjects. Low-income families. Measures. Family income was linked with US. poverty thresholds to identify 2099 families living near or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Food insecurity (i.e., having insufficient funds to purchase enough food to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle) was calculated from the 18-core-item food security module of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Current smoking status was determined. Results. Smoking prevalence was higher among low-income families who were food insecure compared with low-income families who were food secure (43.6% vs. 31.9%; p < .01). Multivariate analysis revealed that smoking was associated with an increase in food insecurity of approximately six percentage points (p < .01). Conclusions. Given our finding that families near the federal poverty level spend a large share of their income on cigarettes, perhaps it would be prudent forfood-assistance and tobacco-control programs to work together to help low-income people quit smoking.

AB- Purpose. The study purpose was to identify barriers to mammography screening among women with different disabilities and to suggest interventions to address barriers. Methods. Forty-two women with self-reported disabilities, ages 40 to 69 years participated. They resided in 24 Connecticut towns, and most had a prior mammogram. Data were collected through six disability-specific focus groups from women with sensory, physical, psychiatric, and cognitive/intellectual impairments. Facilitator-conducted groups used a semistructured guide. Qualitative analysis applied an iterative coding process to generate themes and categories. Results. We identified four themes (i.e., access, beliefs, social support, and comfort/ accommodations) and nine subthemes that characterized barriers. In all focus groups, women mentioned physical access and physical comfort/accommodations as types of barriers. Other major subthemes were communication and professional support. Women also described mammography facilitators. conclusion. Despite frequent use of health care and personal strategies to facilitate mammography screening women with disabilities reported barriers to getting mammograms. Findings suggest a multifaceted approach to address these barriers. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

A paper on obesity and the metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents found that the syndrome is more prevalent among obese children and that obese children have a greater risk of contracting various diseases. A study on alcohol consumption in adolescents revealed that parental opinions play a role in influencing the behavior and feelings of self-efficacy in adolescents. Research on the smoking policies of workplaces shows that smoke-free work environments help decrease the cigarette consumption levels of employees.

AB- Purpose. Describe the development of the leading by example (LBE) instrument. Methods. A total of 135 responses from employees of a private corporation working at 11 different worksites were factor analyzed in 2005. Explorat my factor analysis was used to obtain an initial factor structure. Factor validity was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis methods. A second sample was collected in 2006 from the same population (N = 178) and was used to confirm the factor structure via confirmatory factor analysis. Cronbach's α and item- total correlations provided information on the reliability of the factor subscales. Results. Four subscales were identified: business alignment with health promotion objectives, awareness of the health-productivity link, worksite support for health promotion, and leadership support for health promotion. Factor by group comparisons revealed that the initial factor structure was effective in detecting differences in organizational support for health promotion across different employee groups. Conclusions. Management support for health promotion can be assessed using the LBE, a brief, self-report questionnaire. Researchers can use the LBE to diagnose, track, and evaluate worksite health promotion programs. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Test for a causal relationship between neighborhood design and physical activity within the neighborhood by controlling for self-selection. Design. Cross-sectional and quasi-longitudinal analyses of residents of selected neighborhoods. Setting. Eight Northern California neighborhoods. Subjects. Random sample of 1682 adults stratified by movers (moved within 1 year) and nonmovers (moved >1 year ago) responding to self-administered mail surveys (24. 7% response rate). Measures. Self-reported number of days in last 7 days of moderate to vigorous physical activity somewhere in the neighborhood and self-reported change in physical activity in the neighborhood from prior to moving (for movers) or from 1 year ago (for nonmovers). Analysis. Zero-inflated Poisson regression for cross-sectional analysis (n 1497); ordered probit model for quasi-longitudinal analysis (n = 1352). Results. Aftre we controlled for physical activity attitudes and neighborhood preferences, selected neighborhood design characteristics were associated with physical activity within the neighborhood and changes in selected neighborhood design characteristics were associated with changes in physical activity within the neighborhood. Conclusions. Both cross-sectional and quasi-longitudinal analyses provided evidence of a causal impact of neighborhood design. Improving physical activity options, aesthetic qualities, and social environment may increase physical activity. Critical limitations included self-report measures of physical activity, lack of measures of duration and intensity of neighborhood physical activity, lack of measures of total physical activity, and limited measures of preferences related to physical activity.

AB- Purpose. This study describes the specific type and extent of social support provided l~y family members to older African-American women managing chronic disease. Design. Qualitative study with multiple in-depth interviews conducted over a 2-year time period. Setting. Participants were interviewed in their homes in a large Midwestern city. Participants. This was a purposeful study group of 12 middle-aged and older African-American women with diagnosed early-stage heart disease and other comorbidities. Methods. Data were collected on women's beliefs about their heart disease and their descriptions of how family members helped or inhibited their self-care practices. Women ~ descriptions of family social support were analyzed as to the type and influence. Results. Most women lived in interdependent, multigenerational situations with family members providing: instrumental support; a passive form of informational support based on family history of heart disease that was used to make health comparisons and evaluate heart health; and behavioral support, which emerged, in terms of reinforcement or discouragement of lifestyle behavior changes, as a sometimes significant barrier to practicing chronic illness self-care. Conclusion. These findings, while not statistically representative, demonstrate the significant influence that family members have on older women's chronic illness self-care activities. The positive and sometimes negative effects of living with multiple generations suggest the need for culturally relevant, family-based, chronic illness interventions for African-Americans.

AB- Purpose. To examine the efficacy of an intervention based on the transtheoretical model (TTM) for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption among economically disadvantaged African-American adolescents. Design. Pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study. Setting. Youth services agencies located in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Agencies were assigned to computer intervention (CIN) and nonintervention control study arms. Subjects. A total of 507 African-American adolescents ages 11 to 14 years. Intervention. Youths in the GIN arm completed four 30-minute intervention sessions tailored on TTM stages and processes of change. Measures. Self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption and stages, pros, cons, and self-efficacy for consumption. Analysis. Intervention effects were examined with analysis of covariance models that were controlled for demographic variables and baseline measures of each outcome. Chi-square analyses were used to examine between-and differences in youths' stage progressions. Results. After adjustment by covariates, pros (p < .025) and fruit and vegetable consumption (p < .001) varied significantly with study arm. Youths in the GIN arm had higher pro scores and fruit and vegetable consumption than controls. More youths in the GIN arm than in the control arm progressed to later stages and maintained recommended intake levels (p < .05). Conclusions. A TIM-based intervention can increase fruit and vegetable intake and effect positive changes in TTM variables related to intake among economically disadvantaged African-American adolescents.

AB- Purpose. Investigate whether TV viewing and recognition of snack food advertisements were associated with snack food consumption and the odds of being overweight or obese. Design. Cross-sectional internet-based survey. Setting. University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. Subjects. Undergraduate university students aged 18 to 25 years (N = 613). Measures. Self-reported TV viewing, energy-dense snack consumption, snacking while viewing TV, and body weight. Analysis. Hypothesis testing was completed using multiple analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and logistic regression. Results. Students reporting medium or high TV viewership snacked more frequently while watching TV and recognized more advertising than students who were considered low viewers. High viewers also reported more consumption of energy-dense snacks than low viewers. Snacking frequency appeared to be related to TV viewing and place of residence, but the association between snacking frequency and TV viewing was not accounted for by advertising. Conversely, the association between TV viewing and consumption of energy- dense snacks was accounted for by advertising recognition. Finally, male students (odds ratio [OR], 2. 78; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-4.59) and medium (OR, 3.11; 99% CI, 1.37-7.08) and high (OR, 5.47; 99% CI, 1.97-15.16) TV viewers had higher odds of being overweight or obese. Conclusions. Associations were found among TV viewing, energy-dense snack consumption, and snacking behavior, and between TV viewing and body weight status. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Describe best practices for implementing a variety of lifestyle interventions targeting cardiovascular disease risk factors. Approach. A mixed-methods approach was used to collect and analyze data. The study was guided by the RE-AIM framework. Setting. Selected Well-Integrated Screening and Intervention for Women Across the Nation (WISE WOMAN) projects funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Participants. Five of the 15 currently operating WISE WOMAN projects were selected for study. Selection was based on availability of quantitative performance data, which were used to identify two high-performing and one low-performing sites within each project. Method. Qualitative data collection included a review of program materials; telephone interviews with federal, project, and local staff, and site visits. Site visits involved interviews with staff observations of the lifestyle intervention, and discussions with focus groups of participants. Analysis involved writing site reports, developing theme tables, identifying practices of interest, and applying an algorithm to identify best practices. Results. Eighty-seven best practices were identified. We present a subset of 31 practices applicable to other public health programs and for which differences in how high- and low- performing sites used the practices were identified. Discussion. Many of the best practices identified are applicable to broader audiences. Practitioners interested in strategies to recruit, engage, and retain participants and to facilitate behavior change can learn from these practices. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To determine whether a tailored, 6-month, neighborhood-based, physical activity intervention for people aged 65 to 74 years could increase their total physical activity levels and to identify factors associated with physical activity times. Design. A longitudinal, prospective, intervention study. Setting. Perth, Western Australia. Subjects. A total of 573 older adults, recruited from 30 intervention (n = 260) and 30 control (n = 313) neighborhoods. Initial response rates were 74% (260/352) in the intervention group and 82% (313/382) in the control group, which provided the 573 adults for participation in the study. A total of 413 participants (177 and 236 in the intervention and control groups, respectively) completed the program. Intervention. A neighborhood-based physical activity intervention. Measures. A self-reported questionnaire administered at three time points. Physical activity levels were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Personal and demographic information, including perceived financial struggle and proximity to friends, were collected. Analysis. Descriptive statistics, repeated measures analysis of variance, and generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results. The intervention resulted in a significant increase in total average physical activity times of 2.25 hours per week (p < .001). The GEE analysis confirmed significant increases in physical activity from baseline to midpoint (p = .002) and to post intervention (p = .031). Perception of financial struggle (p = .020) was positively associated with physical activity time spent by participants, whereas having no friends or acquaintances living nearby (p = .037) had a significant negative correlation. The main limitation of this study was the restricted duration of the intervention. Conclusion. The program was successful in increasing weekly mean time for physical activity in seniors and in identifying factors that affect their commitment to physical activities. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Participants. Sedentary women (156ET, 125 MT) 40 to 65 years were recruited within a 3-mile radius of each center. Intervention. Both treatments had the same orientation. The ET group had four targeted workshops followed by weekly tailored telephone calls over 24 weeks. Methods. Generalized linear mixed models were used to test effects of treatments on adherence, physical activity, aerobic fitness, and body composition. Results. Adherence was significantly higher in the ET than the MT group and was related to the number of workshops attended (r = .58) and tailored calls (r = .25) received. On-treatment analysis showed significant postintervention improvement in waist circumference and fitness in the ET group; however, these improvements were not statistically different between the two groups. Intent to treat analysis showed a significant increase in fitness, decrease in waist circumference, and no change in body mass index in both treatments. Conclusion. Findings suggest the potential impact of workshop group support on adherence in African-American women. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To test the hypothesis that responses to coronary heart disease (CHD) risk estimates are heightened by use of ratio formats, peer group risk information, and long time frames. Design. Cross-sectional, experimental, between-factors design. Setting. Three regions in England. Subjects. A total of 740 men and women ages 30 to 70 years. Measures. Risk perception, "emotional" response, intention to change lifestyle. Analysis. Logistic regression was used to investigate the impact of numerical format (ratio vs. percentage), peer group risk (personal vs. peer group), and time frame (10-year vs. 30-year) on risk perception. Analysis of variance was used to investigate the impact of these factors on emotional response and intention to change lifestyle questions. Results. Higher perceived risk was observed when risk was presented as a ratio (p < .001) and when it was supplemented with peer group risk estimates (p = .006). Emotional responses to risk information were heightened when risk was presented as a ratio (p = .0004) and supplemented with peer group risk estimates (p = .002). Presentation with ratios also increased intention to make lifestyle changes (p = .047). Conclusion. Perception of CHD risk information is affected by the presentation format. Where absolute risks may appear low, use of ratios and supplementation ofpersonal risk estimates with peer group risk may increase risk perception. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To explore psychosocial correlates and predictors of stage transitions in the precaution adoption process model (PAPM) for fruit intake. Design. A cohort completed three electronic questionnaires, at baseline (time 0), 35 days later (time 1), and another 32 days later (time 2). Setting. Secured Internet Web site. Subjects. A cohort of 735 adults was formed from a random sample of an existing Internet panel. The mean age was 37.5 years, 51 % were women, and 90% were of Dutch origin. Most respondents (48%) had a medium level of education. Measures. Precaution adoption process model stage, risk perception, perception of own fruit intake level, attitude, pros, cons, subjective norms, social support, modeling, self-efficacy, and fruit intake (assessed using a food frequency questionnaire). Analysis. Cross-sectional differences in psychosocial variables and fruit intake across PAPM stages at baseline were analyzed using analysis of variance with Tukey multiple comparisons tests. Predictors of PAPM stage transitions between time 0 and time 1 and between time 1 and time 2 were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results. Factors related to attitude and social influences may be important if one is to decide to act, whereas strong self-efficacy may also be required for acting on the decision to act. Conclusion. Although the results should be replicated in a larger and more representative sample, the PAPM seems a good framework for studying fruit intake. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

Ciudad San dino, Managua, Nicaragua. Subjects. A total of 599 girls were surveyed, 60% nonintervened and 40% intervened. Intervention. Peer methodology consisted of (1) meetings in which girls talked and worked with other girls, (2) mothers taking an active role in the peer groups, and/or (3) girls watching the soap opera "Sexlo Sentido. Measures. Indices measuring changes in sexual knowledge and gender vision. Results. Girls participating in the peer groups were twice as likely to have satisfactory sexual health-related self-esteem. as those who did not participate. Eleven percent of the girls achieved satisfactory self-esteem as a result of the (peer groups X mothers) interaction and 15 % due to the (peer groups X mothers X "Sexto Sentido") interaction. Girls participating in the peer groups were three times (is likely to have satisfactory gender visions; if exposed to all three components, they were almost four times as likely to develop satisfactory gender visions. Conclusions. Peer methodology, participation of a female family member, and an educational soap opera seem beneficial in promoting sexual health-related knowledge and gender vision in young girls.

AB- Purpose. Determine if a "nondieting" intervention focused on intensive training in eliciting the relaxation response enhances health outcomes compared with nondieting interventions without such training. Design. Randomized trial with follow-up at 10 weeks, 4 months, and 12 months. Setting. General community. Subjects. Total of 225 overweight and obese women with at least one other cardiovascular risk factor. Interventions. Three 10-week nondieting interventions: a group program (P1) focused on intensive training in techniques for eliciting the relaxation response (n = 60), a group program (P2) focused on healthy eating and physical activity (n = 61), and a self-guided, mail-delivered version of P2 (P3; n = 101). Measures. The Revised Symptom Checklist measured psychological distress, the Medical Symptoms Checklist measured the experience of medical symptoms, and the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile measured a range of lifestyle behaviors. Self-efficacy for low-fat eating, intuitive eating, and body mass index were also assessed. Analysis. An intention-to-treat analysis was used. Results. At 12 months, P1 produced statistically greater improvements in stress management behaviors and medical symptom discomfort and was the only program to significantly improve self-efficacy for low-fat eating. In P1, the effect sizes for reductions in depression (0.75) and interpersonal sensitivity (0.85) were large. At 12 months, mean weight was unchanged. Conclusion. Inclusion of intensive relaxation response training in a nondieting program for overweight women enhanced stress management and medical symptoms outcomes but not weight outcomes.

AB- Purpose. Estimate the prevalence of and identify characteristics associated with religious congregations' collaboration with health agencies. Design. Cross-sectional analyses of self-report data from the National Congregations Study, a random sample of religious congregations generated from the 1998 General Social Survey. Setting. United States. Subjects. Key informants from 1236 congregations. Each respondent described a single congregation. Measures. Respondents provided open-ended descriptions of congregational programs. Researchers coded program descriptions by content (e.g., domestic violence) and whether the program involved collaboration with a secular agency. Other congregational characteristics (e.g., denomination) were measured by validated measures and linked census tract data. Results. Overall 11.1 % of congregations participated in faith-health collaboration (FHC). Logistic regression analyses found that FHC was more common among congregations with more members, with a small proportion of congregants under 35 years, and with a senior pastor with a graduate degree. Other effects were conditional; for instance, denominational differences varied depending on urban/suburban/rural location and the proportion of low-income members. Conclusion. This study provides the first national estimates of the prevalence of FHC. Such collaborative efforts may require different approaches in different areas. These results can help practitioners identify congregations that may be more willing to collaborate. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the associations among social support, network heterogeneity, and smoking behavior in a large sample of Finnish female municipal employees. Design. Cross-sectional observational study. Setting. Workplaces in 10 towns in Finland. Measures. Smoking behavior and social support from one's partner, relatives, friends, supervisor, and coworkers was assessed by a questionnaire survey in 2000 to 2001. Analysis. Logistic regression analysis. Subjects. Total of 23,069 female employees (mean age = 45 years). Separate models for heavy smoking (⩾ 20 cigarettes per day) were calculated for 4119 current smokers. The association between social support and ex-smoking was examined in 7352 ever-smokers. Results. After adjustment for various confounders, women who reported low heterogeneity of their support network or no support from their partners or relatives were approximately 1.2 times more likely to be smokers compared with their counterparts with high heterogeneity or high support. Low network heterogeneity was also significantly associated with an elevated prevalence of heavy smoking in current smokers (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52; 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.06, 2.19) and a lower likelihood of ex-smoking in ever-smokers (OR = 0.74; 95% CI 0.63, 0.87). The associations were more pronounced among nonmanual vs. manual employees. Conclusion. Our findings suggest an association among network heterogeneity, sources of social support, and smoking in female employees. The preventive impact of these social resources on smoking behavior is stronger among nonmanual female employees. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Objective. We conducted a systematic review of studies designed to increase awareness of knowledge about, and consumption of folic acid before and during pregnancy. Data sources. Studies were identified from Cochrane Library, Medline, and the references of primary studies and reviews. Study inclusion and exclusion criteria Studies included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental interrupted lane series studies, follow-up studies, case-control studies, and before-and-after studies, all of which were conducted between 1992 and 2005 on women ages 15 to 49 years and/or health professionals, evaluating awareness and/or knowledge and/or consumption of folic acid both before and after intervention. Studies were excluded if data were not presented both before and after intervention or were other outcomes than those mentioned here. Data extraction. Data were extracted in relation to characteristics of studies, participants, interventions, and outcomes. Data synthesis. Because of heterogeneity, we performed describing the direction and the size of effects. Results. On average, women awareness increased from 60% to 72%, knowledge from 21 % to 45%, and consumption from 14% to 23%. Conclusions. Interventions had a positive effect on folic acid intakes before and during pregnancy, although the average usage reached less than 25%. (Am J Health Promot 2008;22[4]:237-245.) So what? Further research is needed to design more effective interventions to increase pen conceptional use of folic acid. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Previous research suggests that there is limited evidence to support a negative association, between physical activity (PA) behaviors and television (TV) viewing time in children. The purpose of this study was to extend the research involving PA-TV viewing relationships and to explore potential moderators, including gender ethnicity, weekday/ weekend behaviors, structured/unstructured activities, and seasonal variability. Design. A 9-month longitudinal design, across one school year with assessments every 3 months. Setting. Elementary schools in tile Vancouver and Richmond districts of British Columbia, Canada. Subjects. Subjects (N = 344; 47% female) were 9- to 11-year-old children who participated in a school-based PA initiative from September 2003 to June 2004. Intervention. Not applicable. Measures. Assessments of PA were measured using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children. TV viewing time and structured PA were measured using a self-report questionnaire. Analysis. Basic descriptives, Pearson r bivariate correlations and moderated multiple regressions with mean centered variables. Results. No significant interaction effects were found for any of the proposed moderators. Null bivariate correlations are supportive of findings in previous literature. conclusions. Our results with not find support for PA-TV viewing relations, regardless of gender; ethnicity, structured PA, and seasonal variability. PA interventions aimed at modifying sedentary behaviors, such as TV viewing, may not be warranted. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- This article discusses trusted clinicians and their use in health promotion for employers who are attempting to control rising health care costs. The clinician-patient relationship is highly valued by a large majority of Americans. Most patients believe that their clinicians are honest and competent and will act in their patients' best interests while preserving their confidentiality. Trusted clinicians include primary care doctors, nurses, therapists, pharmacists, and others who provide reliable advice and information about the patients' health and well-being. Trusted clinicians often provide preventive medical advice and services and can contribute to behavior changes.

AB- Purpose. Develop and test a reduced-item version of an established tool to measure employer supports for cardiovascular health. Method. A random set of 1000 worksites throughout New York State was surveyed in 1999 with Heart Check, a 226-item assessment of employer supports for cardiovascular health. Correlation, Guttman, factor, and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses were used to identify reduced-item versions. The reduced-item versions were then assessed for their abilities to similarly rank and detect changes in 255 different worksites participating in an intervention program. Regression, correlation, and κ analyses were used. Results. Analysis of the Heart Check instrument identified two brief versions with 27 and 55 items. OLS regression of full Heart Check scores for these versions had adjusted R² of .95 and .97, respectively. Discussion. Both reduced-item versions demonstrated a moderate to strong ability to reproduce the results observed with the full Heart Check. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To pilot test whether West Virginia Walks changed local policy makers' awareness of walking-related issues. Design. A quasi-experimental design with preintervention and postintervention mail surveys. Setting. Morgantown, WV (intervention community), and Huntington, WV (comparison community). Subjects. One hundred thirty-three and 134 public officials in Morgantown and 120 and 116 public officials in Huntington at baseline and at follow-up, respectively. Intervention. An 8-week mass media social ecological campaign designed to encourage moderate-intensity walking among insufficiently active persons aged 40 to 65 years. Measures. Policy makers listed three problems they believed needed to be addressed in their community. They then rated the severity of several problems that many communities face using a Likert scale, with 1 representing "not a problem" and 5 representing "an extremely important problem." Analysis. Independent sample t-tests were used to examine differences in mean responses at baseline and at follow-up. Results. Statistically significant increases in the perceived importance of walking-related issues were observed among policy makers in Morgantown but not in the comparison community. Conclusions. Integrated communitywide health promotion campaigns designed to influence the public can also affect the perceptions of policy makers. Future research should examine this linkage and determine whether resource allocation and policy changes follow such interventions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Examine the effects of father-child involvement and neighborhood characteristics with young children's physical activity (PA) within a multilevel framework. Design. Cross-sectional analysis of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study—Kindergarten Cohort 1998. Setting. Nationally representative sample. Subjects. Data were available for 10,694 kindergartners (5-6 years; 5240 girls) living in 1053 neighborhoods. Measures. Parental report of child's PA level, father characteristics (e.g., time spent with child, age, education, socioeconomic status, hours worked), family time spent doing sports/activities together, and neighborhood quality (e.g., safety, presence of crime violence, garbage). Child weight status, motor skills, ethnicity, and television viewing were used as covariates. Analysis. Multilevel structural equation modeling with children nested within neighborhoods. Results. At the child level father-child time and family time doing sports together were positively associated with children's PA. At the neighborhood level parental perception of a neighborhood's safety for children to play outside fully mediated the effect of neighborhood quality on children's PA. Overall 19.1% and 7.6% of the variance in PA was explained at the child and neighborhood levels, respectively. Conclusions. Family-based interventions for PA should consider father-child time, with this contributing to a child's overall PA level. Further, neighborhood quality is an important predictor of PA only to the extent by which parents perceive it to be unsafe for their child to play outdoors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study examined associations of environmental variables with obesity prevalence and individual body mass index (BMI) among impoverished residents of public housing developments. Design. Cross-sectional data were drawn from two studies in the same Midwestern metropolitan area of participants within neighborhoods. Setting. Pathways to Health interviewed housing development residents and Understanding Neighborhood Determinants of Obesity assessed built environment factors in the surrounding neighborhoods (i.e., 800-m radius from center of housing development). Subjects. Four hundred twenty-one residents participated (mean age = 43.8 years; 72.0% women, 59.6% high school degree, 79.6% African-American). Fifty-five physical activity resources were identified and assessed. Measures. Demographics and measured weights and heights were obtained for participants. The Physical Activity Resource Assessment measured the type, accessibility, features, amenities, qualities, and incivilities of neighborhood physical activity resources. Neighborhood street connectivity was also measured. Results. Average age-adjusted BMI was 31.4 (SD = 1.3), with 45% of residents obese. High negative correlations were found between BMI and street connectivity (p = .05) and between obesity prevalence and resource accessibility (p = .09), number of amenities (p = .04), and amenity quality (p = .04). Higher resource accessibility, feature quality, number of amenities, and fewer incivilities per resource accounted for 71 % of obesity variance (p < .05). Male gender and higher feature quality, F(11, 407)37.19 and 12.66, p < .001, predicted lower BMI among residents. Conclusion. Supportive neighborhood environments were related to lower obesity prevalence and lower BMI among residents. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. This study evaluated the consistency of cardiovascular health information in popular women's magazines against the American Heart Association's (AHA) guidelines for nutrition, physical activity, weight management, and smoking. Design. Six issues of four publications, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Vogue, and Shape (24 total) were reviewed for inclusion. Setting. Content analysis was performed by two independent raters on 162 articles (283 instances of priority-related information). Measures. Articles were rated using a questionnaire developed from the AHA -recommended priorities. Analysis. Results are presented primarily in qualitative form, supplemented by analyses of variance and correlation significance tests when appropriate. Results. Physical activity was the most common topic, followed by nutrition, weight management, and cigarette smoking Information about weight management was less consistent than other areas. Although publications varied widely in the frequency of coverage, there was no significant difference among them in overall consistency of the information. No articles gave information directly contrary to the AHA recommendations. Limitations include the subjective nature of the content analysis and the limited number of publications and time period for review. Conclusion. Women are receiving information related to diet, exercise, weight management, and cigarette smoking in popular magazines. However, the information is variable to the extent that it is consistent with evidence-based prevention guidelines. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. Although reactive telephone helplines for quitting smoking are increasingly popular in the United States, the characteristics of callers using this resource have not been adequately studied. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of the current smokers calling a national reactive telephone helpline (i.e., study population). Design and Setting. In this cross-sectional study, information was obtained from eligible participants telephonically. Subjects. The study included 890 adult current smokers who were new callers to a national reactive helpline. Measures. The information collected included selected demographic and smoking-related characteristics. Analysis. The proportions of the above characteristics were analyzed. Results. There was a significant overrepresentation of blacks, non-Hispanics, women, and urban residents, as well as poorer, older, less educated, and heavier smokers in the study population (p < .01 for all comparisons). Conclusions. Reactive telephone helplines may be preferentially used by population segments who are disadvantaged or smoke heavily and thus are in greatest need for assistance. These helplines may therefore fill a much-needed niche in the marketplace of smoking cessation strategies. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Purpose. To assess the relationship between household smoking restrictions and smoking patterns among Chinese American adults. Design. This is a cross-sectional analysis based on a National Institutes of Health-funded population-based household and telephone survey of 2537 Chinese American adults. Setting. Two communities in New York City. Subjects. The analyses focused on male current smokers (N = 600). Measures. Demographic characteristics, smoking status, household smoking restrictions, cigarettes smoked per day, and past quit attempts were based on self-reported data. Results. Among current smokers, 37% reported living in a home with a complete smoking ban. Smokers with a full household smoking ban smoked fewer cigarettes on weekdays and weekends than smokers with no household smoking ban (p ≤ .05) and were 3.4 times (p < .01) more likely to report having at least one quit attempt in the past 12 months. Smokers with knowledge of the dangers of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure were 2.8 times (p ≤ .01) more likely to have at least one quit attempt in the last 12 months compared with those who were unaware of the danger of ETS and more likely to live in a smoke-free household. Conclusions. Smoke-free home policies and interventions to raise awareness among smokers of the dangers of ETS have the potential to significantly reduce tobacco use and exposure to household ETS among this immigrant population.

AB- Purpose. To investigate sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk-taking behaviors relative to other lifestyle and risk-taking behaviors. Design. The study design is cross sectional. Setting. Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. Subjects. Participants (N = 32,144) were 100% of Air Force recruits beginning basic military training from August 1995 to August 1996. Measures. Recruits completed a questionnaire that included rating the statement "Sex without condoms is sometimes worth the risk of possibly getting AIDS or sexually transmitted diseases." Risky behaviors, such as risk taking, rebelliousness, seat belt use, smoking, alcohol use and binge drinking, opinions of illicit drug use, and lifestyle behaviors, such as dietary intake and physical activity, were also assessed. Analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses examined the relationships between participant characteristics and willingness to risk STI. Results. Sixteen percent stated willingness to risk STI to have sex without a condom. Women and white/non-Hispanic participants were less likely to agree with the statement than men and minority participants. Those who reported willingness toward risky sexual behaviors were less likely to use seat belts, were more likely to binge drink, had more positive views of illicit drugs, and reported eating fewer fruits and vegetables. Conclusion. Results of this study suggest the importance of continued education on condom use and the possibility that multiple risk behavior interventions include sexual risk components.

AB- Purpose. To determine the efficacy of community-based, culturally tailored exercise intervention on the moderate and vigorous physical activity and physiologic outcomes of low-income Latino women (Latinas). Design. A randomized trial contrasted safety education to an aerobic dance intervention. Setting. Interventions were held in a "store-front" exercise site near a community clinic. Subjects. Sedentary low-income Latinas (N = 151; 18-55 years; 70% overweight/obese) were recruited. Retention was 91 % for follow-up measures. Intervention. Three sessions per week of supervised aerobic dance were provided for 6 months. Controls attended 18 safety education sessions over 6 months. Measures. Physical activity and aerobic fitness (VO2max) were primary outcomes. Results. Participants in the exercise group reported more vigorous exercise (p < .001) and walking (p = .005) at post-test than controls. Aerobic dance and unsupervised activity resulted in a five-fold greater increase in relative VO2max compared with controls (p < .001). Although exercise and fitness decreased at follow-up, vigorous exercise (p = .001) and relative VO2max (p < .001) remained higher in the exercise group, suggesting maintenance at 1 year. Conclusion. Culturally tailored aerobic dance can increase vigorous physical activity, possibly generalizing to walking, and the combination can improve cardiorespiratory fitness in low-income, overweight, sedentary Latinas.

AB- Purpose. Compare the impact of offering two versus four downloadable songs on response rates to a Web-based survey. Design. One month after participation in a sexual health workshop, students (N = 138) were invited by e-mail to complete a Web-based posttest. The initial incentive of two downloadable songs was increased to four songs midway through data collection. Setting. University of Alabama at Birmingham. Subjects. Undergraduate participants in a peer education workshop. Measures. Response rates were monitored to assess the impact of varying incentive levels on study attrition. Analysis. Frequencies and Pearson's χ² statistics were used to compare response rates between individuals offered two songs and individuals offered four. Response rates were also examined to assess the impact of doubling the incentive among individuals who were nonrespondents when offered only two songs. Results. Of respondents offered two songs (n = 61), 18% completed the survey. When the incentive was increased to four songs, 26% of those who had not responded to the invitation for two songs (n = 50) completed the survey. Of respondents only offered four songs (n = 77), 57% completed the survey. Conclusion. Increasing incentives from two to four songs significantly improved response rates (p < .001). Determining an acceptable level of incentives for Web-based research has the potential to impact high attrition rates. Downloadable songs could, become a mainstream incentive in Web-based research with young adults. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- The author offers opinions on health behavior promotion. U.S. regulations allowing employers to offer discounts on health insurance premiums to employees who achieve goals such as stopping smoking or weight loss are praised. It is argued that there is no fundamental difference in goals between social activists concerned with the treatment of specific diseases and those engaged in health behavior promotion, as the number of employees with chronic diseases is very small compared to the many who could benefit from improved health behavior.

He also mentions that it is rare to find an article that describes the implementation of an administrative infrastructure for wellness programs in the workplace. He believes that the building of infrastructures would be justified if they included work issues such as safety, ergonomics, and occupational health.

To change this, we need to publish in their journals, speak at their conferences, and collaborate with them on evaluation and research. These collaborations have the additional advantage of our learning how to conduct population level analysis and express findings in the terms policy makers understand. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- This article discusses the arguments made by articles included in this edition of the journal in support of using medical models to provide health promotion and improve the health of typical employees and their family members. The articles also argue that the trusted clinician approach in workplace health is a practical way to improve the health and productivity of employees. The author presents several issues that he believes should be explored in assessing the practical value of such use of the trusted clinician. The issues are divided into the categories of setting-related issues, model-related issues, and operations-related issues.

AB- Purpose. This article examines the usefulness of epidemiologic indices in furthering the understanding of the intention-behavior relationship in the field of physical activity. Design. Six prospective data sets of physical activity were used. Setting. The United Kingdom and Canada in various settings (school, workplace). Subjects. Different segments of the population (students, employees,). Measures. Intention at baseline and behavior at follow-up, both assessed by means of questionnaires. Analysis. Intention and behavior were dichotomized to create a 2 × 2 table; this allowed us to compute four standard epidemiologic indices: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PV+), and negative predictive value (PV-). Results. Sensitivity was 86.3%, which reflected the high sensitivity of intention for exercising, i.e., active individuals were very likely to hold a positive intention. Specificity was 49.5%, which suggested that a significant number of inactive individuals held a positive intention. With respect to predictive values, a low intention was a very good predictor of being inactive (PV- = 88.1%), whereas a positive intention was a moderate predictor of being active (PV+ = 45.5%). Conclusion. These results indicate that intention is a moderate predict or of behavior and that the gap between intention and behavior is caused by high intenders not taking action. Health promotion programs would benefit to target factors that moderate the intention-behavior relationship. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB- Historically, the approach of promoting exercise by emphasizing its effects on long-term health has predominated. Despite this tradition, there is no strong empirical support for such an approach. Recent work has argued that exercise suffers from a "branding problem" and efforts to promote exercise may be better served by switching the focus from the long-term benefits of exercise that improve health, to the immediate benefits of exercise that enhance quality of life. One way to disseminate and reinforce this message could be through a smartphone application designed to monitor daily improvements on quality of life constructs correlated with exercise participation.

A lack of research on these products in terms of their health effects is noted and attributed to their relative novelty. An increase in the amount of advertising of dissolvable tobacco products is cited. A lack of research on the identity of consumers who use such products is examined. Topics for further research on dissolvable tobacco products are suggested including on consumer awareness of the products, their perception among persons who do not use tobacco and their overall impact on public health.

The author argues that rarely do health practitioners make public health a priority and that they will not do so until the faceless nature of public health is replaced with the passion that accompanies individual faces and names. He presents several events and individuals, such as the brain damaged patient Terri Schiavo and her family, to illustrate how putting a face on illness and disease evokes emotion, unlike large scale calamities, and the importance of passion in advancing public health.

He discusses several provisions by both the American Heart Association (AHA) and American Cancer Society (ACS) that have made it difficult to develop national policies that support workplace health promotion, including prohibiting family history questions in employee health risk assessments and efforts to persuade federal regulators to change a provision in the U.S. Affordable Health Care Act that offers employees a health plan premium discount for achieving a specific health goal, such as losing weight.

The author refers to the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care (PPAC) Act and enabling language in section 2705 of the law. That section allows employers to link decisions on health plan premiums to health standards achieved by employees. The provision's endorsement by Health Promotion Advocates is noted. As the aforementioned legal provisions are law rather than regulations, the author expects that employers will be more likely to implement workplace health promotion programs.

Readers of the "American Journal of Health Promotion" recommended the development of a national health promotion plan in 2000 and 2001, which led to the Health Promotion Funding Integrated Research, Synthesis and Training Act. The objectives of the health plan include better coordination between federal agencies and support from the federal government.

The elimination of patient co-payments for employees with prescriptions for blood pressure treatment drugs is cited as an example of what the author states is the potential for Value-Based Design to both lower health insurance costs for a company while at the same time improving the overall health of their employees.

The law, which became effective on May 21, 2008, protects people from employment and health insurance discrimination that is based on genetic information. Five rules developed from the GINA Title I law, concern about compliance costs, and the author's suggestions for how legislation should be monitored are mentioned.

AB- This article presents information about the link between global warming and health as discussed in a series of articles published in "The Lancet." The articles dealt with links in four areas: power generation, built environment, transportation, and agriculture. This article looks at the articles related to transportation and agriculture. Transportation is directly linked to health through statistics for traffic-related deaths and injuries and indirectly through diseases that result from the physical inactivity caused by transportation. Transportation also produces air pollution which results in disability-adjusted life years. Greenhouse emissions from agriculture are higher than from transportation and nearly the same as those caused by manufacturing.
